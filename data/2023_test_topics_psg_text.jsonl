Forrester Research reports that 90% of email gets delivered to the intended inbox, whereas only 2% of a company\u2019s Facebook followers see the company\u2019s posts in their news feeds. Email is especially important in business, with the average employee spending 13 working hours each week with their email inbox. According to Pew Research, six in ten American workers say email is \u201cvery important\u201d for doing their jobs. Email marketing isn\u2019t dead Just as email itself isn\u2019t dead, neither is email marketing. In fact, email marketing remains one of the most successful and cost-effective ways to reach customers. It\u2019s certainly more effective\u2014and efficient\u2014than social media marketing. eMarketer reports that 81% of retail professionals say email marketing is a successful way to acquire new customers, compared to 51% who think the same about social media. That makes email more than 40 times more effective for acquiring new customers than either Facebook or Twitter. That\u2019s due, in part, to the high number of people who read the emails in their inbox, compared to the low number of people who see your social media activity.\n"}

In fact, as of June this year, the RAV4 Hybrid is outpacing the Prius with 29,319 units sold vs. 29,241 from the Prius. It\u2019s a tough fight and far from over yet, but it begs the question, \u201cIs Toyota\u2019s RAV4 Hybrid the new and improved Prius?\u201d Hybrid-buyers-to-be need to know, and we\u2019ve got the answers right here. The RAV4 is catching up to the fuel economy of the Prius The new RAV4 hybrid model\u2019s 40-mpg EPA combined rating might still be far removed from the Prius\u2019s 50-to-56-mpg rating, but it\u2019s a huge improvement over its predecessor\u2019s 32-mpg combined rating. As the RAV4 hybrid\u2019s fuel economy inches closer and closer to the Prius, consumers will no doubt begin to weigh the functionality of the crossover vs. the increasingly insignificant difference in fuel economy. Wikipedia Despite it\u2019s smaller overall size, the Prius still allows for an excellent amount of cargo storage and passenger space. Of course, it can\u2019t compete with the RAV4 hybrid\u2019s increased overall size! At the end of the day, one of the largest factors prospective buyers will need to consider is if they\u2019d rather less space and better fuel economy or slightly worse fuel economy with more space. The price difference and what that chunk of change will get you You can expect to pay $4,000-5,000 more for a RAV4 hybrid. The average RAV4 hybrid price comes in just under $27,000 while the Prius slots in just under $23,000.\n"}

The iPhone 6S follows with a starting price of \u00a3549. The iPhone 7 also starts at \u00a3549, while the iPhone 7 Plus starts at \u00a3669. The iPhone 8 models are the most expensive, as you would expect given they are the newest iPhones. The 8 starts at \u00a3699, while the 8 Plus starts at \u00a3799. Apple iPhone 8 vs iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6S: Conclusion The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus naturally win the numbers game compared to the iPhone 7 and 6S models with a faster processor, more storage, an improved display with True Tone technology, extra camera features in the case of the 8 Plus, as well as wireless charging. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are still great options though, especially given their price reductions\u00a0and the same can even be said for the 6S and 6S Plus if you aren't too bothered about all the latest and greatest features. With a starting price of \u00a3449, the iPhone 6S could be a tempting proposition if your budget doesn't allow for over \u00a3500, while the iPhone 7 offers many of the features found on the iPhone 8 bar the processor and wireless charging so is also worth considering if you have a bit of cash to splash but can't quite justify \u00a3700.

Prices will vary depending on the retailer and the phone's model and capacity, but from what we've seen so far, the iPhone 8 (64GB) averages about $350 and the iPhone 8 Plus (64GB) averages about $450. You can get them refurbished for about $100 less. (You tend to only see refurbished or \"renewed\" stock in the UK and Australia, starting at about \u00a3260 or AU$400 for the iPhone 8, and \u00a3430 or AU$600 for the iPhone 8 Plus.) Unlike current iPhones, the iPhone 8 phones sport an intuitive home button and familiar design. If those are the main draw for you though, we suggest the iPhone SE 2020. Like the iPhone 8, it doesn't have a headphone jack, but as the newer phone, it has better hardware, more software support and a more robust Apple return policy and trade-in value.

One of the best cheeses for people with lactose-intolerance is mozzarella cheese. The great thing is that mozzarella has almost no lactose. Just one ounce of cheese provides around 0.3 grams of lactose. Milk in comparison has 12-13 grams of lactose per cup. For someone with lactose intolerance, they may be able to handle an ounce or two of mozzarella without the typical gastrointestinal discomfort associated with lactose intolerance. Why Does Mozzarella Have Very Little Lactose? Dairy products naturally contain the milk sugar lactose. So milk and fresh cheeses like ricotta contain high amounts of this milk sugar.

For lease cars the tax is included in the lease price. The Tax and Customs Administration (Belastingdienst) makes a distinction between three types of tax: Motor vehicle tax, Bpm and Tax on heavy motor vehicles. Motor vehicle tax\u00a0(MRB / Motorrijtuigenbelasting) The motor vehicle tax is levied in the Netherlands on the possession of motor vehicles younger than 40 years. This is a holding tax. A popular name is \"wegenbelasting\" or \"road tax\". Motor vehicle tax is levied on the ownership of a car of motorcycle, not on its use. It is therefore not important whether you drive a lot or just a few kilometers with the vehicle. Originally, the motor vehicle tax was collected as 'target tax': the aim was to pay for the construction and maintenance of roads (those using the roads pay for it).\n"}

Types of Brewer\u2019s Yeast Modern brewing names two types of Yeast, namely ale yeast and lager yeast. Both of these yeasts have different characteristics. But the type of Yeast you use depends on what type of beer that you want to make. It is considered best to try various yeasts and then observe which one suits your needs best. The Four types of Brewer\u2019s Yeasts are: Ale yeast: this type of Yeast is the ideal choice for making stouts, wheat beer, and porters. Ale yeasts have one common property: Their ideal fermentation temperature is 20 C. Belgian Yeast: This Yeast has a distinct fruity flavor with an estery character. And it goes without saying that Belgian Yeast has a high alcohol tolerance as they are used in beer brewing.\n"}

This formulaic and downright boring tradition gave the Nolan trilogy a perfect springboard into the mainstream, taking all that came before it and boldly going in a new direction. The Dark Knight was so popular because it didn't have that same corny, colorful, comic book feel to it. It looked at all of the over-the-top, cookie-cutter aspects of the genre and did away with them, making Gotham and its citizens feel like they could exist in the real world. The likes of Batman, Two Face, and the Joker became real people with real motives. Gone were the days of the superhero caricature, with cheesy one-liners and flamboyant costumes, and so began the dawn of the dark, gritty re-imagining. It wasn't bogged down by the need to sell toys or connect into a grander universe. The film stood on its own while also acting as a continuation of the Batman Begins story. The Dark Knight was a breath of fresh air not only for the Batman character but for the superhero movie genre in its entirety. Superhero Movies Are Much Different Now Fast forward to today, and in one way or another superhero movies have changed since The Dark Knight.\n"}

Scientists now need more high-quality studies on histamine intolerance to better understand the condition and the best treatments. An article in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics suggests an individualized approach to nutrition is best for people with histamine intolerance. Factors such as medication, stress levels, and a person\u2019s overall health all affect what works for them. Research in 2017 recommended a phased approach to the diet. This entails 10\u201314 days of avoiding histamine foods, followed by up to 6 weeks of reintroducing foods. This allows someone to determine their histamine tolerance. Before trying any type of restrictive diet, people should seek expert nutritional counseling to ensure they are getting adequate nutrients, and to avoid an unnecessary reduction in their quality of life. Foods to avoid The following foods contain higher levels of histamine: some types of fish aged cheeses processed meats wine and beer sauerkraut fermented products spinach eggplant tomato avocado Studies indicate that some foods can \u201crelease\u201d histamine in the body, even if they do not contain it.

With child seats in the back, legroom is still good up front and we found a 180cm driver can sit in front of a rear-facing child seat. If you put the rear-facing child seat on the passenger side this allows a taller than 180cm passenger in front of it. So if you are tall parents with baby twins or two rear-facing youngsters the RAV4 is a win! The practicality continues to the boot space, where the boot floor has a plastic coasted side and a carpeted side so it can be turned over when you have the dog or something dirty likes kids' bikes and scooters or wet and sandy beach things because it can easily cleaned off and wiped down. Such a simple idea but makes a really big difference! The boot of the Toyota RAV4 will hold a large dog or fifteen shopping bags when empty, which is comparable to\u00a0the Subaru Forester and two more than the Kia Sportage. A single or compact stroller fits easily in the boot with a good amount of space for shopping bags etc next to it and even a tandem or twin side-by-side stroller will fit in the boot with space for five or six shopping bags around them. The boot is deep enough that the retractable roller blind will go over the top of them too. The media system in the RAV4 Hybrid still has that basic look and feel for the user.\u00a0\n"}

The focal point needs to be the spotlight of the plate and where people look first. Shining or flashing colors, height, and food arrangement support to highlight items. Normally, our eyes scrutinize a food plate like a picture, from the bottom left to the top right. Photographers utilize this idea for their photoshoot. This idea is commonly known as the rule-of-thirds, that splits a picture into three portions both horizontally and vertically and leverage the crossing lines as focal points. The array of the subject or content should be someplace at any of these focal points and commonly off-center.

Ale vs. Lager \u2013 Common definitions When people attempt to explain the difference between ale and lager, several factors related to brewing are usually presented, so let\u2019s look at these first. Top-fermenting vs bottom-fermenting yeasts One characteristic commonly used to distinguish ales from lagers is that ales are brewed using \u201ctop-fermenting yeasts\u201d while lagers are brewed with \u201cbottom-fermenting yeasts\u201d. To brew beer, the four basic ingredients are water, malt, hops and yeast. In simple terms, yeast ferments the malt, and hops are added to counteract the malt\u2019s sweetness. And when talking about the difference between ale and lager, people will often tell you that lagers are brewed with yeast that sinks to the bottom of the tank to do its fermenting while ale yeast does its business at the top. Warm fermentation vs cool fermentation Another commonly stated difference is that lagers are fermented at colder temperatures, usually around 42-55\u00b0F, while ales are fermented at warmer temperatures, usually in the range of 60-75\u00b0F. Fermentation happens more slowly at lower temperatures, so it also follows that lagers take longer to brew since their fermentation process is not as fast. Storage times \u2013 \u201clagering\u201d The word \u201clager\u201d is derived from the German word lagern, meaning \u201cto store\u201d, and this is because lagers were originally stored in caves while they matured. Lagers were first brewed in Bavaria in southern Germany where they were traditionally made during the winter and left in caves until the spring when they were ready to drink.\n"}
{"doc_id": "clueweb22-en0003-96-10594", "passage_id": "7", "passage_text": "\nIncidentally, when it comes to top vs bottom fermentation, this can just be seen as a natural result of the way the two species of yeast behave during fermentation rather than a defining quality in itself. Besides, within the tank, fermentation takes place at all levels regardless of the type of yeast; the distinction between top and bottom fermentation is really just a convenient way to talk about the process and is more related to the appearance of the liquid during fermentation. What can you expect from a typical lager or ale? renegade brewing Since the only true difference between lagers and ales is the type of yeast used for fermentation, it is all but impossible to say what an ale or lager \u201cshould\u201d taste like. The terms \u201cale\u201d and \u201clager\u201d both cover innumerable styles, and there is significant overlap, so, for example, plenty of blonde ales resemble many people\u2019s idea of a lager, and lagers exist that are closer to what some people might think of as an ale. A good example is the so-called India Pale Lager, a generously hopped beer much akin to an IPA (India Pale Ale) \u2013 except that it\u2019s brewed with lager yeast. However, one important difference is that ale yeast releases more esters and phenols, the compounds responsible for fruity or spicy flavors in beer. This means ales are often brewed to showcase these flavors while in lagers, the flavors come from other ingredients like malt. As a result, very broadly speaking, lagers usually have a cleaner, crisper taste while ales are more often richer, deeper, more complex or \u201cfunkier\u201d. That said, it should be obvious by now that when it comes to ales vs lagers, there are always exceptions, and many beers exist that don\u2019t follow the rules.\n"}

However, depending on the preparation method and sauce, you can easily pair Salmon with ros\u00e9 or light-bodied, low-tannin red wines. First, we\u2019ll discuss the nature of pairing a wine directly with a very basic salmon and then offer a few options of pairings depending on the sauce and preparation method. Let\u2019s do this! Pairing Wine with Salmon Pairing With Plain Salmon Plain slow-roasted Salmon ends up being quite soft and delicate. The more steak-like version can be a bit more mealy and flaky, but for the most part, when appropriately prepared, expect the grain to be softer and somewhat mushy.   Here is a good example of how to prepare Salmon. Pair a plain and simple Salmon with an oak-aged white wine or time-aged white wine, something with more robust Meyer lemon, nut, or br\u00fbl\u00e9e notes that will spice and texture the fish.   On the richer side, try a Sonoma Coast or Central Coast Chardonnay from California, a Viognier from Paso Robles, an aged white Rioja from Spain, an oak-aged Trebbiano/Chardonnay from Sicily, or an Australian Chardonnay from Victoria (maybe Mornington Peninsula) or a S\u00e9millon from Hunter Valley.     These wines will align in richness and combine with the Salmon and create a fuller overall taste.\n"}

In short, a vegan keto diet will consist of roughly 70% fats, 25% protein, and 5% carbs, coming exclusively from the keto-friendly plant-based foods listed throughout this guide. This eating approach will allow you to reap the benefits of going vegan and keto with one diet. The Benefits of Following a Vegan Keto Diet A plethora of health benefits are associated with vegan and ketogenic diets, but no research studies examine what happens when we combine the two together. The closest thing to a vegan keto diet clinical trial was conducted in 2013, comparing a vegan, low-carb diet (also referred to as \u201cEco-Atkins\u201d) to a high-carb, lacto-ovo vegetarian diet. Though the vegan, low-carb group was allowed 26% carbs per day, their results were still significantly better than the high-carb group. After six months, they experienced 2 pounds more weight loss and greater reductions in LDL-C and triglycerides. These results follow in line with the benefits that researchers have found for vegan diets and keto diets. Vegan diets, for example, have been shown to lower the risk of various chronic health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. People who adopt vegan diets also tend to lose more weight than those who include animal products like meat and dairy in their diets.\n"}

Losing sleep to exercise is a common problem with gym newbies, he said, and can lead to more soreness and risk of injury. It can also defeat the purpose of strength training in the first place, since lack of sleep means you aren't giving your muscles time to grow and adapt, stalling your gains. \"It's like bending over to pick up a dime and missing the $10 bill in front of you. It doesn't make sense,\" Duffin said. Most research recommends at least seven hours of sleep for the average adult, and up to nine or even ten hours for some elite athletes. Be consistent Another common mistake gym newbies make is what Duffin calls \"shiny object syndrome\" \u2014 trying out many different workout programs in a short time, without spending much time on any of them. \"People are trying to find the secret sauce. They'll try an approach for a month and then hop to the next thing, but the only way you can learn what works for you is to stick with something,\" he said.\n"}

Sous vide is a low-temperature cooking method where food is vacuum-sealed and slowly cooked in a water bath. French for \"under vacuum,\" sous vide uses heated water to gently cook food so that it stays juicy and flavorful. The water temperature is well below simmering, anywhere from 125 degrees F to 195 degrees F. Effectively, the temperature you choose for your sous vide machine will be the same temperature of your food when it's cooked. For something like a medium-rare steak, this is very handy. Sous vide also gives food a uniform texture by cooking inside and outside at the exact same rate. A sous vide steak is medium rare all the way through, instead of being pink in the center and grey around the edges. This is a common problem with dry-heat cooking methods like pan-searing or grilling \u2014 the outside of the meat tends to cook before the inside, resulting in unevenly-cooked food. Sous Vide Duck Breast | Photo by Chef John A Brief History of Sous Vide Cooking Sous vide originated in France during the 1970s. It appeared in the United States nearly a decade later, but it was not well-received.\n"}

Only recently have home cooks adopted sous vide cooking \u2014 and with a variety of affordable models on the market, this once intimidating cooking method is now much more accessible. Sous Vide Equipment Sous vide cooking requires two tools: a vacuum-packing machine and an immersion circulator. The vacuum-packing machine seals the food in an airtight, food-grade plastic pouch. Removing the air inside the pouch not only helps lock in flavor, but it also protects the food from getting soaked with water during cooking.

This tool acts as a heater, thermometer, and pump that moves the water around to keep the temperature consistent.

You can cook a large cut of meat, such as pork shoulder, at the beginning of the week and use it for sandwiches, quesadillas, soup, and more for days afterwards. Sous vide is also useful for special occasion dinners. You can easily whip up a restaurant-quality medium-rare steak or duck breast for guests for a fraction of the cost.\n"}

However, do any of these anti-allergy medications cause significant side effects when used long-term? Allergy test on wrist - Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock Allergy medications are of different types. The following types are dealt with briefly, focusing on those with known side effects following prolonged use. Antihistamines Histamine is a molecule primarily involved in causing the symptoms of immediate allergy by its local action on smooth muscle fibers and on blood vessels. It acts through four types of receptors, H1 to H4. Antihistamines act by blocking H1 receptor actions, which are chiefly responsible for allergic reactions. Antihistamines reduce symptoms like itching, nasal congestion, tearing up of the eyes, raised red skin rashes, dizziness, nausea and cough. Antihistamines are among the most commonly used drugs and are available in many forms. They are available both by prescription and over the counter.\n"}

Typically home brewers use this style of yeast due to its stylistic uses and the ease\u00a0of controlling the temperature range\u00a0inside the brewers home due to modern technologies, such as heating and cooling air units. The range of temperature is between 50\u00b0F- 77\u00b0F (10\u00b0C-25\u00b0C), in consideration of the strain of course. Most strain are between 64.4\u00b0F-71.6\u00b0F (18\u00b0C-22\u00b0C), which could be commonly reasonable to maintain in ones home. Brewers would use ale yeast most common for different ales, stouts, porters, wheat, Altbier and K\u00f6lsch. Lager (Bottom-Fermenting) Yeast Lager Yeast, in the opposite way of Ale yeast, ferments on the bottom of the wort or carboy, as well as convert the sugars at a colder temperature than Ale yeast. this colder process is called \"lagering or lager style\". This lagering process has a lower temperature range from 44.6\u00b0F-15\u00b0F\u00a0(7\u00b0C-15\u00b0C). Due to the lower degree in temperature the fermentation process does lake longer, yet it also reduces the off flavor productions. Lager beers have been considered to be \"cleaner\" or having a \"crisp\" flavor profile, such as Pilsners, Bocks, Marzen, Dortmunders and other lagers styles.\n"}

However, if we don\u2019t start preparing now for future pandemics, the window for action will close. Covid-19 has been a catastrophe: The toll in the United States alone is more than 614,000 lives and has been estimated to exceed $16 trillion, with disproportionate impact on vulnerable and marginalized communities. But a future pandemic could be even worse \u2014 unless we take steps now. It\u2019s important to remember that the virus behind covid-19 is far less deadly than the 1918 influenza. The virus also belongs to a well-understood family, coronaviruses. It was possible to design vaccines within days of knowing the virus\u2019s genetic code because 20 years of basic scientific research had revealed which protein to target and how to stabilize it. And while the current virus spins off variants, its mutation rate is slower than that of most viruses.

Cordial comes from the Latin 'cor' for heart, reflecting the medieval custom of serving liqueurs as medicines to stimulate the heart. The French word liqueur also has Latin roots; it is derived from the word 'liquefacere' meaning to melt or dissolve. The Italian word for liqueur is 'liquori', which also encompasses dry spirits and fortified wines. Liqueurs and cordials can be made with everything from holly berries to vipers, including herbs, flowers, roots, spices, fruit and fruit stones. Unfortunately, for many the word 'liqueur' connotes a sweet and sticky (or creamy), low-alcohol, unchallenging drink. True, many liqueurs fit this description - and many of these are very tasty - but there are also many more 'serious' liqueurs out there for the discerning drinker. Origins Recipes for making digestive liqueurs have been discovered in Egyptian tombs and classical Greek scrolls. But it is monks who are credited with the development of liqueurs during the Middle Ages. They were the medical men of their time and hence were interested in plants, herbs and the medicinal and preserving properties of alcohol.\n"}

Google interview questions on coding focus on core coding concepts such as data structures and algorithms. Google interview questions on design focus on product and systems design principles and applications. These are both hard technical skills. Google behavioral interview questions, on the other hand, focus on soft skills to assess interpersonal traits and cultural and organizational fit. Behavioral interview questions, a common part of technical interviews at FAANG+ companies, are particularly emphasized as part of Google\u2019s hiring process.

Over time, the level of fatty acids in the blood rises to a point at which specific enzymes in the liver convert some of this fat into molecules called ketone bodies.\n"}

It\u2019s important to emphasise that this is not a long-term treatment option, because following such a restrictive diet is unlikely to be nutritionally adequate. You will need to work with a registered dietician to remove foods that are high in histamine or histamine-releasing. Using a food diary, you will be advised to record your reaction to foods as you slowly reintroduce them, while\u00a0carefully assessing tolerance levels and considering other relevant factors. Guided by your dietician and following this initial assessment, you will be able to establish a long-term eating plan that is balanced and suitable for your needs. To help get you started, here are some common foods and their likely histamine effects. You should be aware that histamine levels may vary, so this is given for guidance only: Keeping a food diary is an important component of this approach, because it helps you identify problem foods and pinpoint preparation and cooking methods that may need to be adapted. Keeping a diary can be quite revealing and might suggest some foods, even those usually considered healthy, may be a problem. In the first instance, when aiming to reduce symptoms, eliminating alcohol, dairy and fermented foods may be helpful, because these foods contain histamine and some promote the release of histamine. Other foods block the activity of the DAO enzyme and as such should also be avoided, including\u00a0caffeinated drinks.\n"}

Although both are distilled spirits that contain alcohol and are crucial ingredients when mixing cocktails, the liquids are not the same and the terms are not interchangeable. Generally speaking, liquor is not sweet, while liqueurs are. However, many liquors are available in flavored forms, which just adds to the confusion. Liquors are the basis of a drink while liqueurs are mainly used as flavoring agents in mixed drinks (but many can also be enjoyed on their own). Liquor Liquor, also known as spirits,\u00a0is an alcoholic beverage made of grains or other plants that are fermented into a potent drink. Though a few others fall into this category, it's generally accepted that six types of distilled spirits are liquors: brandy, gin, rum, tequila, vodka, and whiskey. The distillation process, which occurs after fermenting, separates the water from the alcohol.\u00a0 This process increases the alcohol content of liquor to at least 20 percent alcohol by volume (ABV). Brandy, rum, tequila, and vodka are generally 40 percent ABV, while whiskey usually ranges from 40 percent to 55 percent ABV.\n"}

The 2021 Formula 1 teams based in the UK are McLaren, Williams, Aston Martin, Mercedes, Alpine, Red Bull Racing, and Haas. This is surprising to some because several of these teams are known to be from countries outside of the UK. The three truly British Formula 1 racing teams in the 2021 season are McLaren, Williams, and Aston Martin. These three teams are British companies, British manufacturers, and all-around British teams. The other teams on the list merely have headquarters in the UK but were originally founded in other countries. Let\u2019s examine these teams a little more closely. McLaren Formula 1 Team McLaren was founded in the UK and is based in Woking in Surrey, England. McLaren is the second-oldest team competing in Formula 1 after Ferrari and consequently is the second most successful team in the sport. McLaren currently holds 8 World Constructor\u2019s Championship titles, 12 World Driver\u2019s Championship titles and has won a total of 183 Formula 1 Grand Prix Championship races.\n"}

As the southern hemisphere headed into their winter, they lacked not only vaccine doses, but the basics for vaccine distribution, like syringes and adequate refrigeration. These shortages were borne of both weak supply chains and limited supply because of pre-ordering huge volumes of vaccines in high-income countries \u2014 some of which went unused and expired. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) formed by governments, international donors, nonprofits and pharmaceutical companies can help build local capacity to combat COVID-19 and help prepare low-income countries for the next pandemic. Such PPPs will be a win-win. Low-income countries build local capacity and take ownership over manufacturing, distribution, and supply-chains while pharmaceutical companies gain a foothold and valuable partnerships in new markets. PPPs have played a key role in tackling previous global health crises, such as HIV/AIDS. The U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) utilized PPPs to strengthen logistics and supply chains and HIV lab practices. PEPFAR has played a critical role in prevention of new infections and managing existing infections through effective treatments, saving 20 million lives. PPPs could form the backbone of developing local vaccine manufacturing and distribution capabilities to get more people vaccinated in low-income countries and save lives.\n"}

It all starts with wort. Wort is a term used in brewery to refer to beer in its unfermented form. It is a liquid formed at the end of the mashing process. Mashing, in a brewer\u2019s language, refers to the process of heating a combination of grains, predominantly malted barley, in hot water. Other supplementary grains that are added to the mix include wheat, sorghum, rye, and corn. Mashing releases enzymes in the malt, which then act on the starch content in the grains. The enzymes convert the starch into sugars. Sugars are usually converted into maltose. The end product of mashing is a malty liquid, popularly known as wort.\n"}

Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA Damian Carrington Environment editor @dpcarrington Tue 12 Feb 2019 06.25 EST Last modified on Tue 12 Feb 2019 12.15 EST Electric cars are already cheaper to own and run than petrol or diesel alternatives in five European countries analysed in new research. The study examined the purchase, fuel and tax costs of Europe\u2019s bestselling car, the VW golf, in its battery electric, hybrid, petrol and diesel versions. Over four years, the pure electric version was the cheapest in all places \u2013 UK, Germany, France, Netherlands and Norway \u2013 owing to a combination of lower taxes, fuel costs and subsidies on the purchase price. Researchers from the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT) said their report showed that tax breaks are a key way to drive the rollout of electric vehicles and tackle climate change and air pollution. Carbon emissions from transport are a big contributor to global warming, but have been rising in recent years in the European Union. Vehicles are also a source of much air pollution, which causes 500,000 early deaths a year in the EU. Electric cars offer the biggest savings over diesel in Norway (27%) as the battery-powered vehicles are exempt from a heavy registration tax. The ICCT analysis was updated for the Guardian after recent cuts in the UK\u2019s grants for electric car purchases. It shows British drivers see the smallest saving \u2013 5%.\n"}

Source: ICCT Sandra Wappelhorst, from the ICCT, said: \u201cMost trips are within an electric vehicle\u2019s range, and it is the battery electric vehicle that turns out to be the most cost effective over four years. But if you\u2019re a country doctor, who might have to respond to emergency calls at odd hours in odd places, you\u2019ll have to evaluate a battery electric car differently to a London surgeon.\u201d Wappelhorst said financial incentives for electric cars would not be needed when purchase prices fall to that of fossil-fuel powered cars, which is likely between 2025 and 2030. \u201cIt will happen, because battery costs are dropping and that means that the initial price of the vehicles will drop as well,\u201d she added. Cost is not the only factor, Wappelhorst said. While electric car owners can also benefit from reduced parking and road toll charges, they need to be confident there are sufficient charging points. Regulation is also needed to push car manufacturers toward low-emission vehicles, she said. The analysis showed plug-in hybrid vehicles were often the most expensive to run over four years, in part due to the higher purchase of vehicles that in effect have two engines.\n"}

But which exercise should ideally come first? Should you even do cardio and strength training on the same day? You can, in fact, combine cardio and strength training into one workout \u2014 there are even benefits of doing so. But the order of cardio and weight training, as well as the intensity of each, depends on your goals. What is Cardio? To clarify what we mean by cardio, let\u2019s introduce a few key definitions. Cardiovascular exercise, or \u201ccardio\u201d for short, is aerobic physical activity. Any physical activity that increases your heart rate and gets your blood pumping can be considered cardio. For example, water aerobics, jumping rope, dancing, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) sprints, trail running, walking and football are all examples of cardio.\n"}

For example, water aerobics, jumping rope, dancing, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) sprints, trail running, walking and football are all examples of cardio. While these activities differ drastically in their intensity and movements, one thing is the same \u2014 your heart rate elevates, blood circulation increases, muscles contract and your body moves rhythmically. Some types of cardio training can be anaerobic, too. The difference between this and aerobic exercise is the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic cardio, like HIIT sprints, rely on breaking down glycogen (stored carbohydrates) to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate \u2014 the energy currency of your cells!) without oxygen. Whereas aerobic running breaks down fat and glycogen for fuel, with the help of oxygen to meet energy demands.\n"}

One in five teachers feels tense about their job all or most of the time, compared with one in eight workers in similar professions, analysis by the National Foundation for Educational Research revealed. With rising pupil numbers, a shortfall in trainees and more\u00a0teachers quitting earlier on\u00a0in their careers, experts warned there is an urgent need to ensure there are\u00a0enough teachers. The report also revealed\u00a0that the number of teachers trained overseas or returning to the profession has not increased despite\u00a0government efforts to encourage a move into British schools. Recruitment from countries in the European Economic Area are in particular decline, possibly as a result of\u00a0Brexit, according to the analysis. Working intensively over fewer weeks of the year leads to a poorer work-life balance and higher stress levels among teachers, the study found. Two out of five teachers (41 percent) are dissatisfied with their amount of leisure time, compared to 32 percent of similar professionals. Reducing teachers\u2019 workload would reduce the numbers of teachers quitting the profession, the report suggested.

What Causes Histamine Overload? Before we get into the more specific factors that can increase histamine levels, it\u2019s important to understand the different groupings that contribute to our overall histamine load. Sources of histamine can be generally broken down into two categories: endogenous (internal) and exogenous (external). Exogenous, or external, sources of histamine are essentially food sources. When we eat something that contains high levels of histamine (including fermented or aged foods and processed foods), this contributes to our overall histamine load. This is especially true if DAO activity or levels are low, as DAO is the enzyme that is responsible for breaking down dietary histamine. Endogenous, or internal, sources can be a bit more complicated. Mast cells, a type of white blood cell, release histamine as part of our normal immune system response. However, in some cases, mast cells are activated too frequently, releasing unnecessary amounts of histamine.\n"}

How to deal: Depending on where you live, hot weather for at least part of the year may be unavoidable. Try to avoid too much direct sun on hotter days, and stay cool indoors with the help of fans, breathable bedding, and a splash of cold water on your face as needed.

Many foods are high in histamine, promote the release of histamine, or limit its breakdown. What food contains histamine? These foods include shellfish, nuts, chocolate, citrus fruits, tomatoes, black and green tea, spinach, fermented foods, collagen, and bone broth. For the vast majority of people, the amount of histamine in a food simply isn\u2019t an issue. If your system is working right, it immediately inactivates any histamine you don\u2019t need, using two enzymes called DAO and HNMT, and that\u2019s the end of the story. Sometimes, however, things go wrong. A number of factors, from genetic mutations to medical conditions like Crohn\u2019s disease, can lead to high levels of histamine.\n"}

Steaming is basically a cooking method that employs hot steam to conduct the heat to the food, without disturbing\u00a0it in a boiling liquid, leaving us with tender, moist results\u2014when done correctly. The Science of Steaming When steaming, food is actually cooked at a higher temperature compared to poaching, braising, and stewing. Once water is heated past the 212 F mark, it stops being water and turns into steam. Steaming has an advantage over methods such as boiling or even simmering in\u00a0that there is no agitation involved, so it's gentler on delicate items like seafood. And because it doesn't require the food to be submerged, it avoids the loss of nutrients through leaching. It also cooks relatively quickly.

Your physical therapist is the best source of information on what's right for your body and your injury.

Almost any form of exercise, from low intensity activities like yoga to high intensity activities like a Tabata class can act as a stress reliever, no matter your fitness level. Here's how it works: Physical activities that get your heart rate up release endorphins When your heart rate is raised, your body naturally releases endorphins, which are essentially your brain's main way of making you feel good. You've probably heard of the \"runner's high\" and other phenomenon - that's people's brains releasing endorphins as they exercise. You don't need to be a fitness enthusiast to get this effect, though - any activity that gets your heart rate up will cause your brain to release endorphins. Simply put, any time you're earning PAI, your body will release endorphins, helping you to feel good and less stressed in the long term. Exercise tends to focus your mind on one thing (the activity you're doing), instead of everyday stressors As we exercise, our brain will shift more and more focus onto that particular activity. Even if it's subconscious, such as placing one foot in front of the other or taking another breath, your mind will gradually focus mostly on the activity you're doing. This is more likely the higher the intensity of the exercise, as you may need to concentrate on the specific movements you're doing. Physical activities improve your mood Regular exercise can increase your energy levels, overall mood, and can even lower symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n"}

Additionally, increased levels of physical activity can also improve your sleep, which is often disrupted by stress. Long term effects Relieving stress through physical activity is not only good in the short term, but great in the long term. By earning PAI and reducing your stress levels, you'll lower your risk of mortality from cardiovascular and other lifestyle diseases. If you earn 100 PAI or more on a regular basis, you will also slowly see your resting heart rate (RHR) get lower, thereby lowering your Fitness Age in the PAI Health app. This is an indication of your cardiorespiratory health, so if you're able to lower or maintain your Fitness Age that means you're doing a great job staying active and reaping the benefits of less stress and a healthier lifestyle.\n"}

Getting rid of the fat makes the meat lower in calories and lower in cholesterol.\u00a0  Also, steaming removes the need for cooking oil or fat, which results in lighter and healthier meals. 2 . PRESERVES THE FIBER, COLOUR AND FLAVOUR OF VEGETABLES By steam-cooking, the vegetables are kept as close to their natural raw state as possible, whilst still heating through thoroughly. This not only prevents the vegetables from turning into a mash or pur\u00e9e,\u00a0 but it also allows them to retain their original colour, taste, juices and freshness. If you want to add some aromatic flavour to the food, you can add herbs and spices to the water. 3. \u00a0 RETAINS THE VITAMINS AND MINERALS Many of the vitamins and minerals found in vegetables are lost with some conventional methods of cooking.\n"}

Currently, several studies prove that these two main causes which can produce stress in workplace. One of causes is work-related cause. Regarding work-related causes of stress, it includes job requirements, job role, work overload, work underload, organizational change, and other stressors. Firstly, Job requirements are the most significant factor which cause stress in the workplace. There are some demands which can make a job more and more stressful \u2013 for instance, risk and danger. Police officers, firefighters, and other people in occupations where they often have to face physical threats always need to reduce the stress (Arnold et al. 2010). Secondly, Role-stressors include role conflict and role ambiguity (Woods & West 2010). It affects the work settings and social support. Role ambiguity can also be a source of stress if a job description is too vague, and therefore employees are unsure of what duties they have in the office.\n"}

Being either obese or overweight increases the risk for many chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and stroke). Although diet and exercise are key determinants of weight, environmental factors beyond the control of individuals (including lack of access to full-service grocery stores, high costs of healthy foods, and lack of access to safe places to play and exercise) contribute to increased obesity rates by reducing the likelihood of healthy eating and active living behaviors (5--7 ). States and communities are responding to the obesity epidemic in the United States by working to create environments that support healthy eating and active living (8,9) and by giving public health practitioners and policy makers an opportunity to learn from community-based efforts to prevent obesity. However, the absence of measurements to assess policy and environmental changes at the community level has impeded efforts to assess the implementation of these types of population-level initiatives for preventing obesity. To address this issue, CDC initiated the Common Community Measures for Obesity Prevention Project (the Measures Project). The goal of the Measures Project was to identify and recommend a set of obesity prevention strategies and corresponding suggested measurements that local governments and communities can use to plan, implement, and monitor initiatives to prevent obesity. For the purposes of the Measures Project, a measurement is defined as a single data element that can be collected through an objective assessment of policies or the physical environment and that can be used to quantify the performance of an obesity prevention strategy.. Community was defined as a social entity that can be classified spatially on the basis of where persons live, work, learn, worship, and play (e.g., homes, schools, parks, roads, and neighborhoods). The Measures Project process was guided by expert opinion and included a systematic review of the published scientific literature, resulting in the adoption of 24 recommended environmental and policy level strategies to prevent obesity.\n"}

If you have type 2 diabetes, that's probably OK as long as your blood sugar is under control, you don't have any complications that are affected by alcohol (such as high blood pressure), and you know how the drink will affect your blood sugar, according to the American Diabetes Association. An alcohol-containing drink a day might even help your heart (though if you don't already drink, most experts say that's not a reason to start). In moderation, alcohol may cut heart disease risk According to a study by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health, women with type 2 diabetes who drank relatively small amounts of alcohol had a lower heart-disease risk than those who abstained. A second study found that men with diabetes had the same reduction in heart risk with a moderate alcohol intake as non-diabetic men. In general, the recommendations for alcohol consumption for someone with type 2 diabetes are the same as anyone else: no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women. (Make sure to measure: A drink serving is 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor such as scotch, gin, tequila, or vodka.) People with diabetes who choose to drink need to take extra care keeping food, medications, alcohol, and blood sugars in balance.\n"}

But if you are not, then you could absorb too much iron leading to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation from too much iron.\u00a0  And, this will increase your histamine levels. Quercetin and Stinging Nettle \u2013 Can They Replace Antihistamine Medications? Quercetin is a polyphenol found in many foods, with one of the rich sources from the Allium or onion family.\u00a0  Foods like green onions, garlic, leeks, yellow onions, and red onions are rich in quercetin. But you would have to consume a large amount of these foods to have the same effect as an antihistamine medication. Stinging nettle is a common medicinal herb found in teas and supplements and is a potent antihistamine. As seen with HistaEze by Designs for Health, combining quercetin, stinging nettle, and vitamin C is a powerful natural antihistamine.\u00a0  With a lower vitamin C dosage, you are less likely to experience vitamin C's adverse side effects.\n"}

Could Fiber be a Natural Antihistamine? Allergies and histamine intolerance have become more prevalent while the Western diet has become very low in fiber-rich foods.\u00a0  Could there be a connection? A recent study determined if fiber-rich foods and the metabolites produced in the gut from fiber reduced histamine levels. They found that specific fibers, including resistant starch, helped regulate mast cells and reduce histamine levels! Fiber also helps produce anti-inflammatory compounds like butyrate that reduce inflammation in the gut and help resolve IBS and IBD.\n"}

What are Natural Antihistamines and Do They Work? Many natural antihistamines reduce histamine by either reducing inflammation or by blocking histamine production from the mast cells. Chronic inflammation increases the release of histamine and is a significant contributor to histamine intolerance. Therefore an anti-inflammatory diet like the Mediterranean Diet can be very effective at reducing histamine levels. Other natural antihistamines help support DAO production, the key enzyme that blocks histamine absorption from our food and degrades histamine. Foods Rich Polyphenols Reduces Inflammation & Histamine Some of the foods rich in polyphenols or bioactives are not just anti-inflammatory; they reduce histamine production, acting as a natural antihistamine. One study found that watercress, a cruciferous vegetable, inhibited up to 60% of histamines released.\u00a0  Watercress is very rich in vitamins and compounds that significantly inhibited histamine release.

Supplementing with vitamin C does come with challenges, however. Using vitamin C as an antihistamine requires larger dosages, upwards of 2000 mg.\n"}

In California, stress is recognized as a legitimate form of work-related injury. However, you can\u2019t win your claim simply by proving you are under stress. You must also prove that the stress led to a problem that is recognizable as a psychiatric health condition by the state. These include post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, and others as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders from the APA. Stress injuries often occur over time with prolonged exposure. If working in a high-stress environment has caused you to experience an emotional or physical injury, contact the personal injury attorneys at The House of Workers\u2019 Compensation. Let a California personal injury attorney evaluate your case to see if you have a valid workers\u2019 comp stress claim.

One study found that a histamine skin prick test that measures the rate of reaction resolution showed 79% sensitivity and 81% specificity in diagnosing histamine intolerance, but this test is still considered experimental and is not commonly used (19 ). Another test sometimes used for diagnosis is serum DAO activity. In those with histamine intolerance, serum DAO activity is lower than that of healthy controls (8, 9 ). No test is perfect, so trying a low-histamine diet is often the simplest and most effective option! Reducing Histamine Intolerance Symptoms One of the most effective ways to manage histamine intolerance symptoms is to follow a low histamine diet. Consuming less histamine reduces symptoms and may correspond with increased DAO levels in the blood (although not all studies have shown a DAO increase) (60, 61 ). Foods to Avoid On a low-histamine diet, it is important to avoid foods that contain high amounts of histamine. The longer food has been aged, the more amino acids have been converted to histamine. So, fermented foods have the highest levels (2 ).\n"}

Manufacturing is the process of making the components that go into the iPhone. While Apple designs and sells the iPhone, it doesn't manufacture\u00a0its components. Instead, Apple uses manufacturers from around the world to deliver individual parts. The manufacturers specialize in particular items\u2014camera specialists manufacture the lens and camera assembly, screen specialists build the display, and so on. Assembling, on the other hand, is the process of taking all the individual components built by specialist manufacturers and combining them into a finished, working iPhone. The iPhone's Component Manufacturers Because there are hundreds of individual components in every iPhone, it's not possible to list every manufacturer whose products are found on the phone. It's also difficult to discern exactly where those components are made because sometimes one company builds the same component at multiple factories. Maritsa Patrinos / Lifewire Some of the suppliers of key or interesting parts for the iPhone 5S, 6, and 6S and where they operate, included: Accelerometer: Bosch Sensortech, based in Germany with locations in the U.S., China, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan Audio chips: Cirrus Logic, based in the U.S. with locations in the U.K., China, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore Battery: Samsung,\u00a0based in South Korea with locations in 80 countries Battery: Sunwoda Electronic, based in China Camera: Qualcomm, based in the U.S. with locations in Australia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and more than a dozen locations through Europe and Latin America Camera: Sony, based in Japan with locations in dozens of countries Chips for cellular networking: Qualcomm Compass: AKM Semiconductor, based in Japan with locations in the U.S., France, England, China, South Korea, and Taiwan Glass screen: Corning, based in the U.S., with locations in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, The Netherlands, Turkey, the U.K., and the United Arab Emirates Gyroscope: STMicroelectronics.

There are many definitions for mindfulness, but essentially, it\u2019s a practice of focusing on a present moment \u2013 giving your full attention to the activity you\u2019re currently doing. Whether that\u2019s listening to music, walking down the street and paying attention to the sounds around you, or watching the birds fly on a sunny day. Not thinking about the past, nor future. One easy way you can practice being mindful is to meditate every day for 5 minutes, focusing on your breath. This is proven to calm the mind and reduce stress.

You can never overeat vegetables because the effort to eat the vegetable burns the calories for it. Notes Always thoroughly rinse your vegetables. Oftentimes, at Asian supermarkets, you\u2019ll see that vegetables are freshly harvested and will have a lot of dirt in parts of the vegetables. I usually soak my vegetables for a few minutes to let the dirt sink to the bottom of the bowl, and then follow up by rinsing at least 2-3 times. Choose an oil that can handle high heat for a longer lasting cook. I use vegetable oil and saffron oil as opposed to olive oil. Use a nonstick pan to cook vegetables. Make sure when heating up your pan with oil, that it is warm and not steaming hot. If your pan gets too hot, your garlic will burn quickly and ruin your dish.\n"}

That is why we\u2019ve compiled a list of the 10 best Ryan Reynolds movies, ranked. It should also be known that these movies were ranked for the movie quality and watchability, not just for the most Ryan of the Reynolds\u2019 performances. 10. Just Friends (2005) 47 % 6.2/10 pg-13 96m Genre Comedy, Romance Stars Ryan Reynolds, Amy Smart, Anna Faris Directed by Roger Kumble watch on amazon One of Reynolds\u2019 more sincerely funny comedy films, this movie is the silly rom-com follow-up for his crude and ridiculous role in Waiting, which makes Just Friends look like a shining light on his career. A coming-of-age tale, a younger, more plump Ryan Reynolds develops a deep-seated fear of \u201cthe friend zone\u201d from a scarring high-school experience that broke his heart and turned him into a stone cold, womanizing, modern-day Ryan Reynolds. Co -starring Anna Faris in her prime, the overtly redundant premise was saved by these characters and their freedom to go wild, resulting in some great moments of slapstick flair and comedic timing. 9. The Nines (2007) 52 % 6.2/10 r 100m Genre Drama, Fantasy Stars Ryan Reynolds, Melissa McCarthy, Hope Davis Directed by John August watch on Amazon Part documentary, psychological thriller, and comedy, The Nines really pushes the boundary of sci-fi and try-fi, going a bit too far with the plot twists and turns. The plot, while sufficiently intriguing, could be toned down a bit.\n"}
{"doc_id": "clueweb22-en0018-95-16498", "passage_id": "4", "passage_text": "\nThink Memento meets The Number 23 if early Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it. While this movie isn\u2019t all that director/writer John August dreamed it would be, Reynolds really helps to tie the characters together as they twist and turn through puzzling storylines. Overall, this movie is great for a mind-melting double feature kind of night, since you could definitely make up a movie drinking game for it on the fly. 8. Life (2017) 54 % 6.6/10 r 104m Genre Horror, Science Fiction, Thriller Stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, Ryan Reynolds Directed by Daniel Espinosa watch on Amazon A reasonably frightening sci-fi project, Life takes on the premise of a crew that gets trapped out in space. Ryan Reynolds joins the crew as they discover evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars, but it\u2019s not the friendly greeting they were hoping for. Partnered with a group of formidable actors and a commitment to the genre, Reynolds delivers an unforgettably chilling scene that escalates the film to its fear potential. With some moments of questionable physics and flawed characters, this movie isn\u2019t on any list of best sci-fi movies, but it will definitely get you to look around the dark room you are watching it in. 7 . The Voices (2014) 58 % 6.3/10 r 101m Genre Comedy, Crime, Horror, Fantasy Stars Ryan Reynolds, Gemma Arterton, Anna Kendrick Directed by Marjane Satrapi watch on Amazon In this surprisingly overlooked black comedy, Reynolds embodies a psychopath with a child-like outlook and demeanor who just wants to live his life free from disruption.\n"}

Filled with murderous naivety and moments of extreme discomfort, there are lots of laughs to be had as well, namely the scenes where Ryan Reynolds was able to get creative voice dubbing for his two house pets. With all that this movie has to offer, Reynolds finishes it by smoothly making this character his own by becoming sociopathic Ryan Reynolds. 6 . Mississippi Grind (2015) 77 % 6.4/10 r 108m Genre Drama, Thriller Stars Ben Mendelsohn, Ryan Reynolds, Yvonne Landry Directed by Ryan Fleck, Anna Boden watch on Showtime In this A24 production, Ryan Reynolds is a fast-talking gambler who charms another chronic gambler (Ben Mendelsohn ), sparking an instantly toxic friendship and a road trip to escape their ever-worsening problems. Boisterous yet graceful, the story unfolds as the lies and the addiction get worse, making the characters become more transparent to each other. A bit slow-paced for the typical movie-goer, Mississippi Grind is a realist drama to check out if you want to peek into the mind of an addict, where \u201cWe can\u2019t lose.\u201d 5. Definitely, Maybe (2008) 59 % 7.2/10 pg-13 112m Genre Comedy, Romance Stars Ryan Reynolds, Abigail Breslin, Elizabeth Banks Directed by Adam Brooks watch on Amazon Definitely a chick flick, maybe one of the best, Definitely Maybe is a touching story with an all-star cast that serves up a creative slice of the rom-com genre. We explore the love life of an almost-divorced Ryan Reynolds as he explains to his daughter (Abigail Breslin) how he and her mom met, omitting the real names of his past lovers in the story for her to guess.\n"}

{"doc_id": "clueweb22-en0019-79-01649", "passage_id": "11", "passage_text": "\nThese panic attacks can be partially attributed to the role of histamine in vasodilation or the widening of blood vessels within the heart (8 ). This function causes blood pressure to drop as blood flows through the vessels more freely. In conjunction, the heart rate increases in order to continue pumping a consistent level of blood through the newly widened vessels. This reduction in blood pressure combined with the increased heart rate can result in shortness of breath, dizziness and a rapid heartbeat; together causing the individual to feel as though they\u2019re experiencing a panic attack. Again, the connection between histamine and stress can worsen issues such as panic attacks, with the further issue being that stress and histamine release both increase. As with the other conditions discussed, this may potentiate further panic attacks, and increase both histamine and stress levels. 7 Ways to Reduce Histamine and Stress When it comes to histamine and stress, it's important to note that stress acts as the trigger rather than the cause of histamine intolerance. However, taking steps to manage your stress levels can still be very effective in minimizing your symptoms. Working to identify the source of your stress as well as taking steps to manage it effectively are important practices to adopt. Although personal sources of stress may vary, below are some universal methods for effectively reducing stress and histamine release.\n"}
{"doc_id": "clueweb22-en0019-79-01649", "passage_id": "7", "passage_text": "\nHow are Histamine and Stress Related? Stress, in particular, can be a problem for those experiencing histamine intolerance, as it can trigger an increase in histamine release, often exacerbating present symptoms. Let me give you a brief science lesson... When the body is under stress, it releases the stress hormone cortisol which calls the nervous system into action. The hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis is then stimulated by the nervous system which puts the body into \u2018fight or flight\u2019 mode. This cascade of events signals the body that it is under attack and, so, all of its resources are poured into energy conservation, which causes high energy processes such as digestion to shut down. Following this, the sympathetic nervous system is engaged; releasing neurotransmitters such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine to sharpen the senses and put your body on high alert for danger. As part of this stress response, the sympathetic nervous system can further activate the immune system, leading to mast cell degranulation and the release of even more histamine into the bloodstream. Histamine and stress are related in this way, with the outcome being that stress increases histamine release. While these evolutionary mechanisms are advantageous when the body is under significant external threat, the real problem occurs when this stress response is habitually triggered due to the various environmental and psychological stressors we are frequently exposed to.\n"}

Overtime, the histamine and stress response cycle can increase histamine release, which can spark a number of symptoms, including: Histamine and Anxiety & Depression: Histamine and stress are able to cause significant mood disorders due to the role of histamine in the brain. The presence of H3 histamine receptors in the brain explains the high occurrence of mood disorders in those who are histamine intolerant. In the brain, histamine acts as a neurotransmitter which can affect the levels of mood altering neurotransmitters such as GABA, dopamine and serotonin; causing the increased expression of anxious and depressive feelings. Histamine and Insomnia: Histamine has been indicated in the onset of sleep disturbances; both in the case of insomnia and excessive sleepiness. Recent research reveals that histamine may in fact play an integral role in the circadian rhythm (6 ).\n"}

Higher alcohols are also known as fusel alcohols, including n-propanol, isobutanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, isoamyl alcohol, and 2-phenylethanol (Humia et al., 2019 ). Isoamyl alcohol and isobutanol have significant effects on beer flavor (Humia et al., 2019 ). Some studies have been found that the beer flavor is heavy when isoamyl alcohol content increased (Tokpohozin et al., 2019; Vidal et al., 2013 ), while the high content of isobutanol was found undesirable to beer quality (Kobayashi et al., 2008 ). Moreover, the esters combination and the higher alcohol content are crucial factors to produce balanced and quality beers (Pires et al., 2014 ). Therefore, it is necessary to control the productions of esters and higher alcohols in beer. In beer brewing, esters and higher alcohols are mainly produced by yeast metabolism (Pires et al., 2014 ). The yeast strains used for beer fermentation can be divided into two categories: top-fermenting yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bottom-fermenting yeast (Saccharomyces pastorianus) (Hiralal et al., 2014; Tokpohozin et al., 2019 ). Besides the yeast strain type, wort composition and fermentation condition are also important factors affecting beer fermentation (Bokulich & Bamforth, 2013; Hiralal et al., 2014; Saerens et al., 2008 ). Many reports have been focused on controlling these factors to regulate the productions of esters and the higher alcohols (Hiralal et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2019 ).\n"}

With intolerance, your body has accumulated too many, and you are dealing with a temporary overload. While the body naturally breaks down histamines, if you get too many at once, your body\u2019s natural processes may not be able to keep up. What Is A Histamine? Most of us know about antihistamines. When you have seasonal allergies, for example, antihistamine medications relieve your symptoms like watery eyes, a runny nose, sneezing, and congestion. Antihistamines are designed to counteract histamines. Your white blood cells (immune fighters) produce histamines in response to an allergic reaction or injury. Histamines help rid your body of something the body does not want, such as pollen or dust. Histamines can make you sneeze or itch, but do so for a useful purpose: to protect the body.\n"}
{"doc_id": "clueweb22-en0021-00-02320", "passage_id": "4", "passage_text": "\nHistamines make your blood vessels dilate so that your white blood cells can race faster to the site of an infection or injury. Sometimes your cells release too many histamines. This causes something similar to an allergic response.[1]Some people experience unexplained headaches or migraines, while others have digestive issues, break out in hives or rashes, or feel nauseous or tired. Others get an itchy or swollen tongue when they eat foods, like bananas, avocados, or eggplants, or become flushed when they drink red wine. If you experience symptoms like these, histamine intolerance could be the culprit. Histamine Intolerance vs. Histamine Reaction A histamine reaction is part of the body\u2019s natural immune response mechanism. Histamine intolerance occurs when that natural reaction goes overboard, your body can\u2019t break enough down, and a stronger reaction occurs. Intolerance is a disequilibrium in the body between having too many histamines and not being able to break them down fast enough. How Common is Histamine Intolerance? Histamine intolerance affects at least one percent of the population, though the actual percentage of people affected is thought to be higher.[1]Eighty percent of people affected are middle-aged or older \u2014 although it\u2019s not clear why.\n"}

Exercise Mistake #2: Neglecting Your Warm-up Most people would be better off only warming up instead of exercising without warming up at all. Warm-up activities relax joints and gently increase blood flow, heart rate, and body temperature to prepare you for a more vigorous workout. Sometimes a warm-up can also provide essential mental preparation. A great way to warm-up is foam rolling. If you\u2019re a beginner, start by utilizing these foam rolling exercises before your next workout. Exercise Mistake #3: Sticking With Only One Exercise According to the National Institute of Health, physical activity should help develop strength, endurance, flexibility, and balance. Obviously, some kinds of exercise focus more upon one or two of these benefits than others. Also, mixing up your fitness routine can keep you from getting bored, shorten rest times, and speed recovery.

If your symptoms resolve on a low-histamine diet and return with the reintroduction of high-histamine foods, this highly suggests your symptoms are caused by histamine intolerance. Testing serum DAO levels may also help diagnose histamine intolerance. Research suggests serum DAO levels correlate with histamine intolerance\u00a0symptoms [ 28, 29, 30 ].

Here are the following cases where substituting butter completely with oil might make a difference to the end product. Substituting Butter in Cakes In cakes where a creaming of butter and sugar is involved in the initial stages, substituting oil equally will not provide as great a result as that with butter. This is because while creaming, you are essentially incorporating air. These air bubbles contribute to fluffy, spongy cakes. I would recommend instead to make a partial substitution for the butter in such cases. Substituting Butter in Brownies From my personal, I have made a successful 1:1 substitution in brownies. Substituting Butter in Pies Butter helps in providing a flaky texture to the pie crust which is something we associate our pies to be. Oil does not provide that texture. Instead you can try using Vegetable Shortening like I have done in my Apple Rosemary Pie Substituting Butter in Cookies Just as in the case of cakes, if you're cookie recipe asks for creaming butter and sugar, then equal substitution of oil would most probably result in denser (even greasy looking) cookies.\n"}

In this case, the yeast that remains suspended in the liquid eats the sugar, fermenting it into alcohol and CO2. The amount of alcohol produced during this secondary fermentation is negligible, while the CO2 produced is just enough to carbonate the beer. As with the forced carbonation method, the CO2 produced through natural fermentation is more than the container (the bottle, in this case) can hold, so the beer is forced to absorb it. As the sugar is being fermented, the yeast is also reproducing, then it dies or goes dormant and drifts to the bottom of the bottle, creating the whitish layer. Does the Yeast Affect the Flavor? In most cases, the dead or dormant yeast cells collected at the bottom of your beer bottle have very little effect on the flavor of the beer. Yeast often makes the beer appear cloudier, especially when it's\u00a0poured in a clear glass, but that is about it. However, with some styles of\u00a0wheat beer, the yeast does enhance the flavor of the beer, usually making it a bit spicier.

Although both these beverages contain alcohol, there is a difference in the alcohol content or proof in them. In fact, the key difference between wine and liquor is their alcohol content; wine has a lower alcohol content, typically less than 15% whereas liquor has a high alcohol content, typically over 30%. What is Wine? Wine is an alcoholic beverage that is made from fermented grape juice. Wine can be also produced from other fruits and cereals, but the term wine specifically refers to the beverage made with grapes. When something other than grape is used to make wine, the name of that substance is used in the name of the wine; for example, rice wine, pomegranate wine, elderberry wine, etc. Wine has been produced by human beings over a thousand of years. There are different types of wines; different varieties of grapes, strains of yeast used, region, alcohol content etc. result in different varieties of wine. The alcohol content of wine usually ranges from 11 \u2013 15% ABV (Alcohol by volume). Some table wines have the alcohol content of about 6%.\n"}

But while cardiovascular exercise can be effective for burning the calories required for weight loss, it\u2019s not always the best option for those who don\u2019t enjoy it. Fortunately, there is another way to use exercise for weight loss: circuit training, which involves doing a series of resistance-training exercises for different movements or body parts with little-to-no rest between each exercise. An effective circuit alternates between upper- and lower-body parts or movements like from push-ups to pull-ups for muscles responsible for different movements in the same region of the body. The following sample workout can help you get started with circuit training for weight loss so that you can reach your goals without having to live on a cardio machine. You can perform this body-weight circuit from the comfort of your own home or in a limited amount of space in a commercial fitness facility. These exercises combine multiple movements and muscle groups in an effort to increase the oxygen demand and subsequent energy expenditure. The Circuit Inchworm Walkouts to Reverse Lunge With Arms Overhead Start with feet hip-width apart and knees slightly bent. Hinge at the hips, place your hands on the floor and walk forward to come to a high plank position.

Depending on your lineage or the type of meditation you are practicing, there will be different practices that you will experience while meditating. During a meditation practice, you are likely to practice: In a stillness In seated or reclined position With the eyes closed or with a soft gaze Breathing techniques Mindfulness A sense of calm and peace Being present in the moment Like with starting anything for the first time, beginning a meditation practice can be challenging. Our everyday lives constantly revolve around movement and being stimulated, that when we begin to slow things down and find stillness, it can prove to be a challenge.\n"}

Which is More Challenging\u2014 Yoga or Meditation? Some people can find a meditation practice more challenging than a yoga practice, or vice versa. During meditation, you become present in your body and the moment through stillness and breath, while in a yoga practice, you can find that same sense of presence through movement, poses, and breath. However, both practices leave you feeling calm, present, and mindful. Some yogis may find it difficult to sit for long periods of time, and find meditation through their physical yoga practice. While some meditators prefer to not practice physical yoga poses to reach a state of relaxation and mindfulness. Benefits of Yoga The physical practice of yoga has a wide range of physical as well as mental and emotional benefits. When you physically practice yoga poses, you build strength and flexibility in the body and often, many people start yoga for this very reason. The mindfulness and awareness aspect of the practice shows up naturally as you get deeper into your yoga practice.\n"}

VW Polo GTI Audi is allegedly, though, putting the finishing touches to even faster S1 and S1 Sportback models, which should comfortably put the Polo GTI in its place in the Volkswagen Groups hot hatch pecking order.

Still, rumours are the S1 will pack a punch north of 200bhp, which could mean the Audi will become a rather prominent four-ringed fly in the Golf GTIs pretty well sorted ointment. So, yeah, that could be something worth thinking about\u2026 Conclusion Judging from what the critics make of them, the Volkswagen Polo and Audi A1 are both stellar superminis, with plenty of positive reviews and awards to their respective names. Both cars have also got some praise in the form of our user reviews, though it is worth pointing that quite a few don\u2019t appear to be satisfied with the A1s ride quality and the running costs that fall short of the manufacturers claims. The A1 is also quite a pricey car when compared with the Polo, though the high-quality cabin, the smart styling and the Audi badge to go some way to justifying the premium. Whether its enough to make the A1 an attractive proposition, however, is purely down to you and your requirements from a car. The fashion-conscious buyer may be tempted to the Audi, but those with more restrictive budgets may find the Polos lower asking price to be the deal clincher.\n"}

Photography and styling are important, but they begin after the food is plated. So arranging food on a plate such that it looks inviting is a challenge every cook or chef must meet if they want their food to be popular. Some aspects of plating food are basic, and you can say they are just common sense. For example, your plate color should contrast with the food, but not garishly so. The food should not overflow from the plate, nor should it be so tiny that it gets lost on a large plate. Different aspects of the dish should be visible. There should be only one dominant color.\n"}

Histamine intolerance occurs when the body is unable to adequately process the level of histamine present in the body. When DAO levels are low or its activity is inhibited, signs of excess histamine can appear. Histamine is a powerful compound that is essential to our health. Excess histamine, however, can cause discomfort and distress. Those who are histamine sensitive or histamine intolerant experience allergy-like symptoms in response to excess histamine consumed in foods, triggered by foods, or released in response to environmental factors. In rare cases, excess histamine is produced to excess by the body\u2019s own mast cells (see Histamine and Mast Cells). Common signs of histamine sensitivity or intolerance include flushing of the skin, rash, itching (esp. eyes, ears, nose), acute temporary rhinitis (sneezing, stuffy or runny nose), red/watery eyes, digestive disturbances and diarrhea. Less common signs include racing heart, chest pain, headache and dizziness.\n"}

Areas like the lower back, hips and obliques can be especially problematic, particularly if you have a body type that tends to pack on fat around the middle. Video of the Day 0 seconds of 29 seconds Volume 0% Along with a healthy, reduced-calorie diet, increased exercise is the best way to blast fat in your problem areas. Regular cardio and full-body strength training will help you burn the excess calories that lead to fat gain and rev your metabolism to increase your body's ability to fight fat. Fat Loss: What You Need to Know Fat loss can be complicated. It depends on the individual -- on their genetics, gender, body type, lifestyle and other factors. But the basic premise is that you put fat on by eating more calories than you burn in a day, and to lose fat you need to reverse the equation. Reducing your caloric intake and burning more calories through exercise should cause fat loss from the back, obliques and upper butt. However, how quickly fat loss happens from specific areas of the body is unpredictable. You can't target one area of the body to lose fat.\n"}

December 17, 2013 12:53 PM Trusted Tools from KBB.com New car prices Trade-in values Sell your car Compare cars Calculate payments A hatchback is a car with a cargo-access door (aka, a hatch) on the rear of the vehicle. The hatch is typically a liftgate with hinges on the top, so it is simple to open and pass cargo through. A hatchback is related to a station wagon, although standards vary by country. The primary advantage of a hatchback is that it allows for easy access to cargo stored in the rear of the vehicle's interior. Hatchbacks are often classified into 3-door vehicles and 5-door vehicles. A 3-door hatchback generally consists of two passenger-entry doors and the hatch, while a 5-door hatchback consists of two passenger-doors in front, two doors for the second row of seating, and the hatch. The hatchback body style has been in use since the 1930s, although the term hatchback has only been in use since 1970.\n"}

How They Are Made Cottage cheese is made from milk (usually cow\u2019s) which been coagulated to form curds. Coagulation happens when a starter like rennet is added to heated milk. As the curds form, the whey (yellowish liquid) separates from the curd. The whey liquid is mostly drained away leaving the curds that are typically rinsed and then mixed with cream, buttermilk, etc., to create that classic cottage cheese taste. Cottage cheese is made with different milkfat percentages: fat-free, 1 percent, 2 percent, and 4 percent (creamed). The nutrition of cottage cheese varies based on the milkfat percentage used. Ricotta cheese is traditionally produced from the leftover whey \u00a0from making other cheeses like mozzarella. The whey is collected and left to sit out to ferment for about a day. It is then heated until a curd is formed and then placed in a cheese cloth for final formation.\n"}

The excluded foods are wide ranging and avoidance for any length of time can be difficult to adhere to, particularly when the individual is already feeling unwell, and could lead to nutritional deficiencies if followed for long periods of time without dietetic support. An additional difficulty, is the lack of consensus on which foods are high in histamine and lists vary in content. Although there have been reports of people with long-COVID achieving symptom improvement on a low histamine diet, to date there have been no studies published in this area. Given the lack of evidence and the associated challenges, elimination of dietary histamine is not currently recommended for long COVID.\u00a0 If an individual is keen to and feels able to trial dietary restriction, dietetic support would be recommended to ensure that it is followed safely and to minimise the risk of nutritional deficiencies.\u00a0 This should be a short-term trial for 2-4 weeks followed by systematic reintroduction of foods to test tolerance levels and broaden the diet. Detailed written information for dietitians to provide to patients has been published by the FASG and is available on the BDA website (for BDA members only ). Dietitians will also advise on other dietary approaches to support symptom relief, recovery and well-being alongside or instead of a low histamine diet.

This is even more relevant in the high intensity, high risk arena of high growth ventures. In our follow-up report in 2019, we examined this even more closely, with some concerning findings. The majority of founders were dissatisfied with their work-life balance, with most working every day in excess of healthy guidelines for working hours. Now, following a year of unprecedented global disruption due to COVID-19, we look further into the stresses that founders are facing, and the impact the pandemic has had on their health and wellbeing. We anticipated that mental wellness would have a more negative impact, but we were surprised to find that founders weren\u2019t in significantly worse shape than in 2019. The report, based on quantitative and qualitative research surveyed 120 founders. It reveals that the majority of founders remain optimistic in the short term and overall future of their startup, and average satisfaction with work-life balance has also improved.\n"}

One of the biggest reasons behind this is the admiration for the never aging Turkish tiles that decorate the historic Ottoman structures. Naturally, travelers want to take souvenirs of a similar beauty with them. Of course, there are many places in Turkey that Iznik ceramics can be bought. However, there is no doubt that the most ceramic shops are located in Istanbul, the touristic capital of Turkey. If you wonder where to buy Turkish ceramics, you should look at the touristic districts of Istanbul. Best ceramic shops in Istanbul located around Sultanahmet and Grand Bazaar.\n"}

Boiling Typically all foods are boiled in water as a form of cooking, boiling is a very healthy form of cooking as foods are completely submerged in the boiling liquid and it is cooked till it is tender then drained, suitable for boiling, liquids suitable for boiling are milk, water, stock, and court-bouillon. A wide range of foods can be boiled too, like vegetables, eggs, pasta, rice, joints of meat, fish, sauces, poultry, and soups. 2 . Stir-Frying Frying is another well-known method of cooking, in a classic stir fry, the food is always cut into similar bite-sized pieces so it can be cooked evenly, this technique of cooking involves moving food using a cooking utensil of some sort and shaking the pan itself, the heat beneath the pan must be very high and with very little oil. This is popular for cooking in Asian cuisine, ingredients are always added starting with the one that takes longer to cook and finishing with the shortest ingredients. 3. Roasting Roasting is pretty similar to baking but it is the least hands-on cooking technique, roasting is a cooking method that uses dry heat where hot air covers te food and let you cook it evenly on all sides with a temperature at least 150\u00ba C from an open flame.\n"}
{"doc_id": "clueweb22-en0028-64-05418", "passage_id": "4", "passage_text": "\nPeople often considered deep-frying food unhealthy but this depends partially on the kind of oil being used and how much is being used. 6 . Braising Braising is a combination cooking technique, it is a\u00a0 term is used in conjunction with meat, typically before braising the foods is first sauteed and seared at a high temperature then it is completed in a cover pot at a lower temperature while sitting in a little amount of oil. Aromatic vegetables like carrots, onions, and other seasoning are sometimes used in this cooking method along with the liquid. 7 . Steaming Steaming is one of the healthiest techniques used in cooking, it works by boiling water which vaporizes into steam and it is the steam that carries heat to the food and the fact that the food is cooked above the heat and not submerged means that all the nutrients stay where they belong in the food. 8. Grilling Grilling is a form of cooking that involves dry heat, it is a technique of cooking food over direct heat, usually fairly high heat. Grilling is a well-known way of cooking and tender cuts of meat, poultry, various kinds of fish and shellfish are well suited to grilling, you can have vegetables and some fruits grilled as well. Grilling is a very fast technique for cooking although the timing varies widely from food to food and from grill to grill.\n"}

Sauteing Sauteing is a really popular method, to saute means is to cook food quickly in a minimal amount of fat over relatively high heat, the definition of sauteing literally means to \u201djump\u201d in french and it describes how foods react when tossed around in a skillet. A variety of fats can be used ranging from butter to various oils or a combination depending on the food you are sauteing. Sauteing is somehow between stir-frying and searing and can be used for making different kinds of food. 10. Broiling broiling refers to cooking food under a broiler, it is a lot similar to grilling but broiling is a top-down heat while grilling is a bottom-up heat. Broiling is very different from roasting and baking as the food is turned during the process. Foods that take best to be cooked with this process are foods that cook through quickly so they don\u2019t burn before they finish cooking inside. Some cooking techniques have been around for a very long while and some have been introduced over the years, every method, however, uses heat to affect food differently, food can be cooked either by direct or indirect application of radiant heat and some cooking techniques does not require liquid to get the food done. Knowing about cooking techniques allows you to work with varieties of ingredients and kitchen equipment to achieve a consistent flavor in your cooking and above are cooking techniques you should know.

That doesn\u2019t mean shifting the responsibility from the government to individuals. What it does mean is that governments need to begin a campaign to assist households by giving them information and resources that they need to prepare for the next pandemic\u2014before it happens. Preparation is something that you do ahead of time. After a disaster hits, you\u2019re stuck with whatever preparation you have. If people haven\u2019t properly prepared, everybody is scrambling to meet their needs in the moment, leading to shortages and strained supply chains. With proper household preparation, we could have avoided the shortages of essential supplies for citizens and hospitals, because households would have already had basic supplies as part of their pandemic supply kits. Ultimately, prepared households introduce slack in the system that allows all of society to be more resilient to shocks.

I often review coding challenge solutions that fail to pass with the provided test input, or just barely work, because the programmer sank a lot of time into trying to add unnecessary flexibility or extra features into the program before the base problem was solved. It\u2019s clear that they ran out of time, half-finished the extra functionality, and slapped the program together just before the deadline. It\u2019s much smarter to solve the problem at hand in the simplest way possible, then improve or extend on your solution if there is still time to do so. Sidenote: this is a good rule of thumb for software projects in general. The Coding Challenge Review It\u2019s increasingly common for companies to call you in to review your coding challenge submission in person. This will almost always involve feedback, and may feel like the interviewer is trying to challenge your technical skills. However, for most Junior coding challenge reviews, the interviewer is trying to figure out something very important: how do you take constructive criticism? As a Junior developer working in a team, you\u2019re expected to occasionally make mistakes, and to receive constructive criticism on your work. In general, it\u2019s fine to make mistakes and take the wrong approach now and again, as long as you respond positively and are open to the feedback.\n"}

Don't worry. Not knowing the best way to respond to a question probably isn't going to knock you out of contention for a job. However, knowing how to respond to a question for which you don't know the answer can help alleviate some of the anxiety and can help you make the most out of a difficult situation. Don't Panic Your mindset going into an interview is a critical ingredient for success. Many candidates assume that they must have a near-perfect interview to land the job. In reality, it helps to recognize that other interviewees will also have difficulty answering all of the questions to the complete satisfaction of the recruiter. Often, a solid but imperfect interview is sufficient to move you on to the next step in the screening process. This realization can help keep you from panicking if you can't answer a question well. Take the time to review the most common interview questions employers ask so you will have an idea of what to expect.\n"}

Try not to stress out. Maintaining a calm, confident posture when confronted with a tough question will help convince the recruiter that your inability to answer a question is an unusual occurrence for you. There are strategies you can use to avoid job interview stress, which can happen to anyone regardless of how practiced you are at interviewing, and stay calm. If you fall apart and get upset, the interviewer could lose confidence in you. However, most hiring managers know that nerves can get the better us and will be understanding. Consider saying something like, \"That's a very interesting question; can I take some time to consider it and get back to you later?\" or \"Great question! I can answer it in part but would like to consider it further and get back to you.\" Buy Some Time You can often buy some time to formulate an answer by rephrasing the question or asking for clarification. For example, you might say, \"Are you looking for an example of how I motivated an underperforming colleague in a team situation?\"\n"}

Can you explain it in greater detail?\" Don't Fake It It can feel embarrassing not to be able to answer a question, but that's better than making something up, especially when what you say isn't an appropriate response. Inventing something that might not make sense is worse than politely and briefly stating that you do not know the answer. If you are genuinely perplexed by the question and do not think buying time, defining terms, or asking the interviewer to rephrase the question will help, say you are not sure. You can try to spin this into a more positive answer by saying that you'll be thinking about this question after the interview, that you'll do some research, or even that you hope to learn more about the topic if hired. If you give that last response, it can be helpful to relate another time you were unfamiliar with a concept and were then able to master it. Such an answer will make you look resourceful.\n"}

This can be fantastic news for people who are looking for natural ways to address Histamine Intolerance. Studies have shown that nature, once again provides those remedies. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most widely used vitamins, minerals, enzymes and how they might be worth considering when you struggle with histamine intolerance. Quercetin: When you intake Quercetin, you are helping your body to calm the inflammation. It also blocks the releases of histamine from your mast cells acting like an antihistamine. Quercetin has strong antioxidant activity and has been shown to support immune health by mediating the release of inflammatory compounds including leukotrienes and prostaglandins. Quercetin is known for its ability to stabilize mast cells, diminishing the release of histamine, the compound known to cause symptoms related to histamine intolerance. Found in my histamine support pack DAO\u2122 DAO is a patented enzyme formula containing diamine oxidase (DAO)\u2014the main enzyme responsible for the degradation of ingested histamine. This enzyme has been clinically tested and found to break down food-derived histamine in the digestive tract.\n"}

This assistance can produce profound effects, as an increased release of histamine from mast cells is one of the primary causes of histamine intolerance, thus indicating that N-acetyl cysteine can relieve symptoms by targeting the root cause of histamine intolerance, rather than the symptom itself. Proteolytic enzymes- Proteolytic enzymes are necessary for breaking down large proteins into smaller ones. Proteolytic enzyme support can help degrade histamine. Proteolytic enzymes also help aid in the absorption of protein, calcium, vitamin B12 and iron- all cofactors needed to make the DAO enzyme. Proteolytic enzymes can reduce circulating allergenic protein complexes. It\u2019s these protein complexes that are associated the allergic reactions seen in histamine intolerance. This is an often overlooked aspect of treating histamine intolerance and it\u2019s one of the reasons I have included the addition of proteolytics in my histamine support pack.

Because black garlic is so special, you need to be careful when storing it. Black garlic that has been unopened can be stored at room temperature. Once you use it, however, it needs to be stored in the refrigerator. Black garlic will keep for about a month after that. Ideally, you should store black garlic in a paper bag or a jar with a towel at the bottom of it. This is because black garlic, especially when homemade, tends to drip.

Here\u2019s a list of healthy cooking oils suggested by Dr Chaturvedi: 1. Sunflower oil Sunflower oil that is high in oleic acid has the highest smoke point. These oils are considered to be good for deep frying. However, repeated heating of any kind of vegetable oil destroys its quality by making more trans fats. It has a mild flavour so you can use it in any type of dish. Sunflower oil is perfect for cooking.

The skin of the fruit is rough and pebbled. But it is what's inside finger limes that makes them special. When cut open (they can also be snapped in half) they reveal a multitude of tiny spherical vessels, ranging in color from pale yellowish-green to nearly pink. They also have small, cream-colored seeds. Squeezing each half forces these little bubbles out, where they can be eaten or used in cooking. When chewed, they pop in your mouth, releasing their tart, lemony juice. Chefs who use them serve them alongside seafood, sushi, pasta, and other foods that benefit from the crunchy pop of the bubbles and their tart, citrusy flavor. The downside to this unique fruit is that they're expensive. If you can find them, expect to pay anywhere from $50 to $100 per pound for them, usually depending on the size of the package.\n"}

Standing out from a crowded pack of applicants can be difficult, but there are ways to show potential employers that you\u2019re a qualified candidate. The STAR method of interviewing can be an important tool for providing context behind the major (and minor) wins in your career. What\u2019s more, not only will the STAR interview method help you stand out, it\u2019s also an effective way to show the interviewer that you\u2019ve got the skills for the job\u2014and the results to prove it.

You need to explain how you raised revenue and what that meant for the company. Doing this gives the interviewer more information about you, your skills, and how you approach and solve problems.

Many of these alternatives are similar in texture but not as strong in taste, appealing to people who like feta recipes but have an aversion to that cheese's strong flavor.

This article documents disparities in access to health services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), using a framework incorporating quality, geographic accessibility, availability, financial accessibility, and acceptability of services. Whereas the poor in LMICs are consistently at a disadvantage in each of the dimensions of access and their determinants, this need not be the case. Many different approaches are shown to improve access to the poor, using targeted or universal approaches, engaging government, nongovernmental, or commercial organizations, and pursuing a wide variety of strategies to finance and organize services. Key ingredients of success include concerted efforts to reach the poor, engaging communities and disadvantaged people, encouraging local adaptation, and careful monitoring of effects on the poor. Yet governments in LMICs rarely focus on the poor in their policies or the implementation or monitoring of health service strategies. There are also new innovations in financing, delivery, and regulation of health services that hold promise for improving access to the poor, such as the use of health equity funds, conditional cash transfers, and coproduction and regulation of health services. The challenge remains to find ways to ensure that vulnerable populations have a say in how strategies are developed, implemented, and accounted for in ways that demonstrate improvements in access by the poor.

As previously indicated in the last Stress Scoop, chewing gum after a meal can prevent heartburn symptoms in GERD patients by neutralizing acid fluids and helping to force them back into the stomach. Chewing gum speeds up peristalsis further down in the small intestine and has been used to treat postoperative ileus following colon surgery for diverticulitis or cancer.\u00a0  In one report, patients who chewed gum after colon surgery resumed normal GI function and left the hospital more than two days sooner than controls. Other studies suggest that chewing gum can cause weight loss and improve concentration and memory. In one article published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Mayo Clinic researchers calculated that chewing sugar-free gum could help someone lose up to 11 pounds a year.\u00a0  Unfortunately, this would require chewing at a fairly rapid rate most of the time you are awake, which could cause dental and gastrointestinal problems.\u00a0  The act of chewing increases blood flow to the brain, which is used to support claims that it improves brain function.\u00a0  College students have long recognized that chewing gum improves memory and concentration during important exams.\u00a0\n"}

Measurement selection The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health [ 15 ], and this definition should serve as the basis for measurement selection. While underwater weighing and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) directly measure body fat, many indirect measures of adiposity have been used to measure obesity status. Anthropometric measures such as the weight-for-height index, BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist\u2013hip ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage estimated by skinfold thickness (ST) are widely accepted indirect measures. Since the 1990s, BMI has been widely used to classify overweight and obesity, both in adults and children [ 16 ].

Poor Management A common mistake among new business owners is thinking they can manage the entire business themselves. Trusting someone else with your personal vision is, of course, difficult to say the least. Your vision is dear to you, your business\u2019s success is directly linked to your personal success. The fact is, not everyone is a good manager. Some people simply can\u2019t manage a business, even if they\u2019re great at ideas or finances or marketing.\n"}

The yeast strain you choose depends on the kind of beer you are hoping to produce. But to get the most joy out of homebrewing, it is recommended you experiment with each kind of brewer\u2019s yeast to see which one you like best. Here\u2019s a short description of four brewer\u2019s yeast types you might find: Ale yeast \u2013 Top-fermenting ale yeast is ideal for wheat beer, Altbier, stouts, ales, and porters. There are multiple strains of ale yeast available\u2014too many to name\u2014but all have one thing in common. They have an ideal fermentation temperature of 20 C/68 F. Lager yeast \u2013 In order to make a lager or a pilsner, you need a different kind of yeast known as Saccharomyces uvarum. This kind of yeast is known as bottom-fermenting, which means the yeast settles on the bottom when fermentation finishes. There are also strains of Saccharomyces eubayanus and pastorianus that are used at low temperatures, where they thrive. Belgian yeast \u2013 Many Belgian brewers have their own proprietary blend of ale yeast for Belgian-style beer. If you want the phenols, esters, and alcohols that make Belgian beer so delicious, you need the correct yeast.\n"}

Cycling is another option if your route to work isn\u2019t too crowded. Strategy 5 \u2013 Work out in your lunch break Working out during your lunch break is another way to fit exercise into a busy schedule.\u00a0  A sixty-minute lunch break offers enough time for you to take a brisk 30-minute walk. You could work out at the gym if there is one near your workplace and still have plenty of time to shower afterward and eat lunch. \u00a0 If you work in a high-rise building, another option is to walk or run up and down the fire escape stairs rather than use the elevator. Along with enabling you to lose weight and become more fit, working out at lunchtime will improve your focus and productivity for the rest of the day. If you have your own office, close the door and do some Squats and Sit-Ups.\u00a0  You can even incorporate your desk or chair to do Standing Push-Ups, Tricep\u00a0Dips, seated muscle toning exercises, and the like.

If you have a baby, buy a jogging stroller .\u00a0  This will allow you to walk or jog and take your baby with you.

These plans combine running and strength training by breaking up a typical strength workout and spreading it out over multiple days. Sample Strength Training and Running Schedule Many runners find that they are able to stay most consistent by completing a few minutes of daily strength training, as opposed to one lengthy workout. This schedule frees up time for running and other cross training workouts, as no day is taken up with strength training. Here is a sample schedule to provide you with an example of how you can combine strength training and running in this way each week. Monday: Easy Run // Bridge, Clamshell, Donkey Kicks, Fire Hydrants Tuesday: Speed Workout // Plank, Side Plank, Bicycles, Russian Twists Wednesday: Cross Training // Squats, Lunges, Step Ups, Pistol Squats Thursday: Easy Run // Bicycles, Windshield Wipers, V Sits Friday: Easy Run // Leg Lifts, Hip Thrusts, Superman Saturday: Long Run // Bicep Curls, Tricep Dips, Arm Extension, Push Ups Sunday: REST! This strength training schedule is straightforward and easy to follow. Completing 20-40 repetitions of the listed strength exercises takes less than 15 minutes each day. By the end of the week, you will have completed exercises targeting muscle groups throughout the body. Use this sample schedule as a way to get started strength training.\n"}

Fortunately for some people who have difficulty digesting dairy or lactose, cottage cheese still may be tolerated due to its lower lactose content. Below are some examples of lactose percentage averages for a selection of dairy foods.

Liquor, also known as spirits are alcoholic beverages made of plants or grains and concocted into a potent drink. Simply put, staples like gin, vodka, rum and tequila are all forms of liquor. Liquor also is distilled and has an alcohol content of at least 20 percent, although 40 percent is more common. Another defining characteristic of liquor is that it is not sweet.

Written by McCall Minnor We\u2019re big fans of high intensity interval training (HIIT). It strengthens our hearts, builds endurance, and can be done just about anywhere. From running on the treadmill to gliding away on the elliptical, HIIT can be stacked with other forms of cardio for a quick and killer workout.

It\u2019s one of the oldest American car brands, and it\u2019s regarded as one of the \u201cBig Three\u201d automobile manufacturers in the U.S. But that statement in itself is misleading; Chrysler is now part of the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles conglomerate, and these days, it\u2019s nowhere near the automotive presence that it once was.

April 07, 2015 by Jordan Cutforth BMW was one of the last of the big German manufacturers to enter the compact car sector but the continued strength of its small car sales means it\u2019s here to stay. Buyers looking at the smallest BMW \u2013 the 1 Series \u2013 might like that it offers BMW quality and performance in a compact body but, if its likely to\u00a0be a squeeze next time you\u2019re packing for your holiday, you might be better off in the marque\u2019s compact SUV \u2013 the X1. So, if you\u2019re looking to acquire the BMW image for the least amount of money, we\u2019ve compared the 1 Series and X1 to see which is the best to buy. BMW 1 Series on the left, X1 on the right Engines The 1 Series offers nine different engines while the X1 only offers six. However, the X1 does offer more flexibility by\u00a0offering four-wheel drive on a wider choice of engines compared to the 1 Series. All the engines available for the X1 (20i, 16d, 18d, 20d and 25d) are all available on the 1 Series but due to the X1 being a heavier, taller, wider and overall less aerodynamic machine than the 1 Series, it\u2019s noticeably less economical. For example, the 18d engine in the X1 with rear-wheel drive and a manual gearbox returns 57.6mpg on the combined cycle where the 1 Series starts at 65.7mpg. The 20d engine in the X1 returns 57.6mpg where the 1 Series returns 62.8mpg.\n"}

Firstly the fresh barley gets soaked in water and put in the so-called germinating boxes to germinate. In this phase the enzymes (amylase) are formed which are needed for the starch separation. The germinating process is then interrupted at the optimal stage by the drying (kilning). The green malt is dried carefully at 80\u00b0 celsius and tastes slightly sweet when dried. The malt sugar later serves to feed the yeast cultures, which then form the alcohol. 2 . Milling The second step in the brewing process is milling. The finished malt is milled, similar to the making of flour, so that it dissolves better in water. Malt mills produce various grades of crushed malt: husks, groats, meal, semolina and powder (from the coarsest to the finest).\n"}

The European Union and Britain have pushed for months for an ambitious treaty or convention that carries legal force. The discovery of the Omicron variant, which has prompted a new wave of travel rules and border closures, primarily targeted at southern African nations where the variant was first identified, has renewed criticism that countries worldwide are acting in a patchwork and discriminatory fashion. \u201cNo better response to the emergence of the Omicron variant than this coming together of the international community behind the effort to strengthen the legal framework underpinning our collective response to pandemics,\u201d Simon Manley, Britain\u2019s ambassador in Geneva, said on Twitter. The United States described the initiative in a statement as \u201ca momentous step\u201d but, with support from Brazil and other countries, it refused to commit to anything that is legally binding, and kept open the possibility of a weaker instrument. The international agreement is intended to avoid any repetition of the \u201cfragmented and splintered\u201d steps by nations that Dr. Tedros has said weakened the global response to Covid-19. Proponents of a treaty want commitments to share data, virus samples and technology, and to ensure an equitable distribution of vaccines.\n"}

Hobbies bring many benefits that usually make them more than worth the time they require. Here are some of the advantages of having hobbies. Health Benefits of Hobbies One study found that those who engage in physical leisure activities for at least 20 minutes once a week are less susceptible to fatigue. Other research found that enjoyable activities performed during leisure time were associated with lower blood pressure, total cortisol, waist circumference, and body mass index, and perceptions of better physical function. Such activities were also correlated with higher levels of positive psychosocial states and lower levels of depression and negative effect. Ultimately, the benefits of hobbies, both psychologically and physically, are worth exploring. Find something you enjoy engaging in and you create time for yourself and your health! Taking a Break Hobbies provide a slice of work-free and responsibility-free time in your schedule. This can be especially welcome for people who feel overwhelmed by all that they have to do and need to recharge their batteries by doing something they enjoy.\n"}

Since hobbies generally incorporate pleasures into your life, maintaining hobbies can be good for your overall sense of joy. Receiving Gratifications Also from positive psychology, gratifications are important activities that bring meaning and fun to life. Gratifications present the kind of challenge that requires us to use some of our best personal skills and engages us in a sense of flow, which can put us in a near-meditative state where we lose track of time and feel removed from the stressors of life, and fully engage in what we are doing. Gratifications can lead to a reduction in stress and a sense of well-being, and hobbies are usually experienced as gratifications. If you want more happiness and fewer stress experiences in your life, hobbies provide a direct route to gratifications that can lead to this. Staving Off Burnout Hobbies bring a sense of fun and freedom to life that can help to minimize the impact of chronic stress. Those who feel overwhelmed at a job, for example, can benefit from hobbies because they provide an outlet for stress\u00a0and something to look forward to after a hard day (or week) at a stressful job. Some research shows that those who are in stressful jobs that normally contribute to burnout (low-control, high-demand jobs, for example) feel less of a need to \"recover\" from their day at bedtime if they have more physical or social leisure activities that aren\u2019t work-related\u2014or in other words, more hobbies. In this study, those who had a need to \"recover\" at bedtime were more likely to suffer from negative health and wellness outcomes like psychosomatic complaints and fatigue.\n"}

Though Qualcomm traditionally reveals its premium system-on-chip around this time every year, the silicon itself doesn't show up in phones until early the next year \u2014 usually in Samsung's new Galaxy S flagship.

However, the sensor is not the only factor that affects an image. There are others like the lens itself and the software supporting the camera. Samsung has doubled down on AI with the Galaxy S22 Ultra, squeezing every ounce of the ISOCELL HM3 sensor's capabilities.

In short, mindful meditation is combining the practice of mindfulness and meditation. Mindfulness is the ability to be fully present and not overly reactive. Whenever you bring awareness to the information your senses are offering, you\u2019re being mindful. [ 1] Therefore, mindfulness meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique \u2013 such as mindfulness, or focusing their mind on a particular object, thought or activity \u2013 to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.

Diamine Oxidase is an enzyme and nutritional supplement provided when the suspected cause of histamine intolerance is DAO deficiency. Table of contents Treating Histamine Intolerance Additional Tools for Histamine Intolerance Medical Mushrooms for Histamine Intolerance Histamine intolerance occurs when histamine levels are too high in the body. When DAO levels are too low, the body cannot metabolize and excrete the excess of histamine correctly. This causes the histamine levels in the body to rise, leading to various symptoms. The complexity of histamine intolerance is rapidly pushing more healthcare providers towards the consideration of holistic treatment methodologies. Additional supplementary solutions could support the performance of DAO and eliminate side effects from histamine intolerance. Treating Histamine Intolerance The most common treatment for histamine intolerance is DAO supplementation. The Diamine Oxidase enzyme in the human body is primarily responsible for breaking down excess histamine in the body. When this substance is in short supply, the body\u2019s natural balance begins to skew, and elevated histamine levels cause side effects like headaches, asthmatic issues, sneezing, nasal congestion, low blood pressure and nausea.\n"}

When this substance is in short supply, the body\u2019s natural balance begins to skew, and elevated histamine levels cause side effects like headaches, asthmatic issues, sneezing, nasal congestion, low blood pressure and nausea. Scientists agree that various factors contribute to diminished DAO activity and the overproduction of histamine, including use of certain medication, bacterial overgrowth in the intestine, and eating high levels of histamine-rich foods. DAO supplements can benefit patients by improving digestive performance, and reducing the risk of issues like migraine attacks and headaches. In studies, patients have shown a 23% reduction in the duration of migraines with DAO supplementation. Some patients have also reported fewer issues with skin rashes caused by histamine intolerance. Unfortunately, DAO supplementation may not be enough on its own, as it doesn\u2019t affect the levels of histamine produced in the body.\n"}

In terms of upgrades, the iPhone 14 lineup is expected to come with an in-display fingerprint sensor in 2022 alongside the Face ID unlocking feature. As per Kuo, the new models\u00a0 could retain the facial recognising TrueDepth Camera system for Face ID or not, or will have both the features to unlock the device. iPhone 14 Pro Max, the top-end iPhone model of the 2022 series, is said to have the lowest price ever, Kuo said.

Tuesday March 9, 2021 8:42 am PST by Juli Clover Amazon maintains lists of its best selling products, and right now, the best-selling smartphone that's available from Amazon is an Amazon \"Renewed\" iPhone 8, which is priced starting at $178. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. That's super cheap for an \u200ciPhone\u200c, and cheaper than Apple's own refurbished price for the same device, so in our latest YouTube video, we picked up one of these Amazon Renewed iPhones to see if it's worth the savings. Amazon's \"Renewed\" devices are all pre-owned and are not Apple certified, but Amazon says they've been professionally \"inspected, tested, and cleaned\" by Amazon-qualified suppliers. Note that the iPhones come from various third-party suppliers and are not necessarily provided direct by Amazon. Amazon has two product grades: Renewed and Renewed Premium. Renewed is the cheapest option and starts at $170 for an \u200ciPhone\u200c 8 with 64GB storage, while Renewed Premium is a bit more expensive. It's worth noting that prices on Renewed and Renewed Premium devices do fluctuate, and sometimes the Premium versions go out of stock.\n"}

Apple doesn't offer a new \u200ciPhone\u200c 8 anymore, but for comparison's sake, charges $339 for a Refurbished version. Amazon says that its Renewed devices have no \"visible cosmetic imperfections\" when held at an arm's length and a battery capacity that exceeds 80 percent relative to a new device, while Renewed Premium versions are \"certified to work and look like new,\" so we chose the Premium option to get as close as possible to new \u200ciPhone\u200c 8. The \u200ciPhone\u200c 8 that we received from Amazon looks and feels like a new device, but it did ship with a non-factory charger and Lightning cable. There were a few hairline scratches on the screen that weren't super noticeable, but will likely annoy perfectionists. After charging, the \u200ciPhone\u200c 8 worked as expected and had a 90 percent battery capacity.\n"}

If you are into trying to DIY your food projects, then there are two popular bases to create your very own dairy-free cheese right at home. You have your choice of tofu-based or almond-milk-based cheese. Tofu-Based Feta Substitutes For the tofu-based recipes, like with most things that involve tofu, it\u2019s all about getting the marinade right. Tofu itself already closely mimics the color and crumbly texture of feta cheese, so this is probably the simpler of the two in-home creations you could try since it is significantly less work. Almond-Based Feta Substitutes Almond milk-based feta recipes create the \u201ccheese\u201d texture by making a modified version of gelatin via the use of agar-agar powder. But that is just meant to re-create the feel and look. It is all about adequately flavoring or brining what amounts to very firm almond pudding to recreate the salty tang of the traditional feta. Commercial Options If you are not someone who prefers to spend time experimenting in the kitchen or you\u2019re busy like many of us are, there are also now in store versions that you can purchase thanks to the growing vegan and vegetarian communities. A company called Violife has a highly rated vegan version of this cheese available in mainstream grocery stores.\n"}

Fermentis has studied in depth the impact of different yeast strains on NE IPA flavor expression. Yeast can affect it in different ways, not only on neutral flavors but how yeast affects the production of and contribution to fruity flavors. In fact, yeast will not only play a direct role in flavor formation, but it can also improve the release of some important hop flavors from precursors. Yeast can favor the hop character of beer by producing, releasing or interacting with important hop aroma compounds. Yeast also has an important role in the body of the beer; its suspension or sugar consumption profile can contribute to the mouthfeel of the beer, especially in this style with its \u201cjuicy\u201d character. Bio Transformation Of The Yeast Biotransformation is the capacity of the yeast to metabolize or transform different molecules, and it is very important in the formation and release of some specific aromatic hop flavor components. Some of these components have intense tropical, citric or floral character. Without the activity of the yeast, these flavors wouldn\u2019t be released and perceived in the beer.\n"}

The downside is less All-Wheel Drive performance on dry roads. Different Types of All-Wheel Drive There are two main types of All-Wheel Drive used in vehicles today: Full-Time All-Wheel Drive: This type of drivetrain uses three differentials to spread the power effectively between all four wheels. The wheels are all receiving power all of the time in this arrangement. Very well-liked All-Wheel Drive systems that have this arrangement include Audi\u2019s Quattro All-Wheel Drive and Subaru\u2019s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive. Rally racing vehicles and their road-going equivalents use this type of All-Wheel Drive setup almost universally. Automatic All-Wheel Drive: There is no center differential with this type of All-Wheel Drive. A transaxle powering one set of wheels directly puts most of the power into the front or rear axles while a driveshaft moves power to the differential on the opposing axle. With this type of system, the driver only gets the benefits of All-Wheel Drive in low-traction situations. This setup takes up less space than the alternative and allows the car to run more efficiently when acting as a Front or Rear-Wheel Drive.\n"}

Some coupes are offered with four doors rather than two, but these are rare outside of German premium car brands. Coupes are usually larger than superminis or city cars but smaller than saloons. Nowadays, many coupes are a little smaller (in terms of both length and height) than your typical family hatchback. If the coupe is a high-performance car, however, it may be noticeably wider than cars that fit into most other body style categories. Coupe is originally a French word (commonly spelt like coup\u00e9) which was first used to describe 19th century carriages which had their rear-facing seats removed. Difference between coupe and cabriolet Because they\u2019re both terms that were originally used to describe carriages, plus the slight similarity of the words, some may be unclear as to how a coupe and cabriolet are different. While coupe cars have a permanently fixed, hard-top roof, cabriolets have a roof which can be folded, allowing for open-top driving. Cabriolet is one of several terms used nowadays, alongside convertible and roadster, which is used to describe cars which have a roof that can be taken down or removed completely.\n"}

This is especially true for restaurants, where sour beers pair well with foods containing salty meat, citrus, tangy cheeses, and egg dishes with creamy sauces. Here\u2019s what you should know about brewing sour beer. Step One: Understand Your Fermenting Options There are four major options for fermenting sour beers. Brettanomyces Sometimes known simply as Brett, this is a common choice for sour brewing. Specific variants offer an incredible variety of flavors, ranging from fruits to hay, sometimes referred to as a \u201chorse blanket\u201d characteristic. Age has a heavy impact on how well this yeast strain performs, with fruity flavors being more common in shorter fermentation cycles and deeper, earthy tones emerging if fermentation keeps going. This is a great yeast strain to start with if you\u2019re not sure what to use. It\u2019s affordable, widely available, and has enough variety for even professional breweries. Lactobacillus and Pediococcus These two bacteria strains are an alternative to using Brettanomyces yeast.\n"}

When performed correctly, HIIT workouts are an effective way for beginners to build muscle. The muscle-gaining benefits of HIIT have been shown in scientific studies which have repeatedly demonstrated that 3-6 weeks of high-intensity training are sufficient to increase muscle size and strength. For example- this 2018 study split 44 overweight men and women beginners into two groups: Group 1 did a 3 week lower-body HIIT program. Group 2 did 3 weeks of nothing (control). The scientists then used ultrasound to determine that group 1 (who did HIIT) saw a significant increase in quadriceps (leg muscle) size. \u201cHIIT can be an effective way to affect muscle size in overweight people\u201d Blue et Al. 2018 Similar results were also shown in this 2021 study which demonstrated that 6 weeks of HIIT workouts increased muscle size and strength in a group of 35 male beginners. Furthermore, this study showed that HIIT seemed just as effective as traditional weight training in benefiting muscle gains.\n"}

Well, any kind of physical activity can promote muscular growth in a beginner. But this 2017 study has also indicated that increased testosterone (a natural hormone that promotes muscle synthesis) is also a contributor to the muscle-building benefits of HIIT in men.

Generally speaking, doing HIIT with weights is good for increasing the muscle-building benefits of a HIIT workout. Popular equipment to use in a weighted HIIT workout includes dumbbells and kettlebells. But any type of resistance training equipment such as barbells and bands can also be beneficial. Ever heard of the phrase \u201cpour gasoline onto the fire\u201d?

However, they are not a substitute for BMI. While waist metrics take fat distribution into account and BMI does not, BMI takes total fat into account while waist metrics do not. So, when used together, these measures tend to provide a more reliable indicator of cardiometabolic risk than either measure used alone. Waist Circumference Waist circumference has a direct correlation with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease 3. Correlations have also been established between waist circumference and the risks of developing other metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes 4, hypertension 5, certain types of cancer 6 and kidney disease 7. The greater the circumference of your waist, particularly when associated with a pronounced \u2018apple\u2019 shape, the greater your morbidity and mortality risks are. Indicator of Relative Risk Waist circumference in its own right is an indicator of the relative risks of developing cardiometabolic diseases. This is due to waist circumference tending to be a reliable proxy for central obesity. In order to mitigate these risks it is important that we maintain a healthy waist circumference.\n"}

This is due to waist circumference tending to be a reliable proxy for central obesity. In order to mitigate these risks it is important that we maintain a healthy waist circumference. Healthy Waist Circumference A healthy waist circumference differs markedly between males and females. The following table details the recommended limits of waist circumference set by the World Health Organisation for both males and females, and specifies the corresponding risk categories for metabolic disease: Waist Circumference Limits and Risk Categories Metabolic Risk Category Males: Waist Circumference Females: Waist Circumference Normal Less than or equal to 94 cm Less than or equal to 80 cm Increased Risk Greater than 94 cm Greater than 80 cm Greatly Increased Risk Greater than 102 cm Greater than 88 cm The message in these numbers is clear. Men should strive to maintain a waist circumference of 94 cm or less, and for women the corresponding goal is 80 cm. Waist to Height Ratio While waist circumference is a reliable indicator of cardiometabolic risk in defined populations, it has been found that a healthy waist circumference in one ethnic group can differ from that in another. For example, Asians have a higher metabolic risk than Europeans at any given waist circumference 8, due to the fact that Asians tend to carry more truncal fat than Europeans for any given BMI.\n"}

Hardware: Choice vs. Polish JOHANNES EISELE / Contributor / AFP Hardware is the first place where the differences between the iPhone and Android become clear. Only Apple\u00a0makes iPhones, so it has extremely tight control over how the software and hardware work together. On the other hand, Google offers Android software to many phone makers, including Samsung, HTC, and Motorola. Because of that, Android phones vary in size, weight, features, and quality. Premium-priced Android phones are about as good as the iPhone, but cheaper Androids are more prone to problems. Of course, iPhones can have hardware issues, too, but they're overall higher quality. If you're buying an iPhone, you need to pick a model. Because many companies make Android devices, you have to choose both a brand and a model. Some may prefer the choice Android offers, but others appreciate Apple's greater simplicity and higher quality.\n"}
