Souq Waqif is an iconic destination and no trip to Doha is complete without visiting this place. Here are some interesting facts about Souq Waqif that you may not have aware of! 1. Souq Waqif was a gathering place for Bedouins It was established over a hundred years ago, a trading place where Bedouins and local people would exchange an assortment of products and socialise. Originally, Souq Waqif immediately adjoined the shore for easy boat access. It still faces the water, but the link to the front is now divided by a major road and a park.

If you are looking for a wonderful place to shop, to dine, to explore or simply sitting at one of the many attractive outdoor cafe to watch the world pass by, look nowhere but Souq Waqif in Doha. For centuries, this location has been a souq for Bedouin (nomads who have historically inhabited the Arabian and Syrian Deserts.) to take the wool and animals to trade for daily necessities. \u00a0 With time pass, the souq started to run down and has almost get to the point of being demolished. \u00a0 Luckily, in 2004, it was\u00a0decided to preserve this historical site so the entire market area has been renovated and restored according to the traditional Qatari architectural techniques. \u00a0 It\u2019s probably the only traditional souq left in the Gulf. Besides the main street, don\u2019t forget to explore the\u00a0labyrinth like alleyways to find more stores.

But as shopping centers began mushrooming across Doha over the decades, the souq gradually fell into disrepair. After a major fire destroyed much of it in 2003, the market was given a facelift with the aim of preserving its cultural and architectural heritage. Out went the modern buildings and in came the whitewashed structures. Cobbled alleys, old lanterns, big wooden doors and ceilings made of bamboo were also added, all lending to the site an aging look -- and a pleasant change of pace from the lofty skyscrapers and modern construction dominating Doha's cityscape. Here's our pick of 10 of the best things to see and do at Souq Waqif: Shop for your wardrobe and home Souq Waqif's textile section is one of the most popular parts of the market. Dimitris Sideridis Whether it's traditional scarves, embroidered cloaks and tailor-made robes that you're after, or pots, pans and other kitchen hardware, Souq Waqif has you covered. There's an abundant display of goods on offer, including some you probably didn't know that existed. As you wander around the souq's many winding alleys, it's inevitable that you'll get lost -- but don't be discouraged, a gem might be waiting for you just around the corner.\n"}

Some time later, the city's name was changed to Rome, presumably after the Italian city of Rome. Rome was listed in the 1820 Federal census of Oneida County, but the exact date and reason for the change is unknown. Rome is one of two principal cities in the Utica\u2013Rome, New York Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is in the south-central part of the county. In the heart of the Leatherstocking Region made famous by James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, Rome is known as the City of American History. For hundreds of years, the area occupied by the modern City of Rome, NY has enjoyed great strategic and commercial importance, sitting along an ancient east/west and northern trade route from the Great Lakes and Canada to the Hudson River and the sea. The city is built astride the Oneida Carrying Place, known to the Six Nations or Haudenosaunee people, as Deo-Wain-Sta, or The Great Carrying Place. These names refer to a portage road or path between the Mohawk River to east and Wood Creek to the west, leading to Lake Ontario. Located within the modern city limits, this short portage path was the only overland section of a trade route stretching over a thousand miles between Lake Ontario and the lower Hudson.\n"}

But once you\u2019ve found your bearings, you\u2019ll find it has a surprisingly compact center and you\u2019ll be able to do much of your exploring on foot. Most top attractions in Rome are concentrated in the area between Stazione Termini, the city\u2019s main transport hub, in the east, and the Vatican in the west. The Vatican, technically an independent country, is one of Rome\u2019s most awe-inspiring areas with two highlight sights: St Peter\u2019s Basilica and the Sistine Chapel (in the Vatican Museums). To the south of the historic center, the Colosseum makes for a dramatic landmark, whilst away to the north, Villa Borghese is an extensive park, ideal for recharging your batteries. You\u2019ll come across many monuments, including the Pantheon, Spanish Steps, and Trevi Fountain in the areas flanking Via del Corso, the nearest Rome has to a main drag. Walking the city you\u2019ll discover Rome is quite a hilly place.\n"}

Ideally, water resource management planning has regard to all the competing demands for water and seeks to allocate water on an equitable basis to satisfy all uses and demands. As with other resource management, this is rarely possible in practice. Water is an essential resource for all life on the planet.

Summary \u2013 Different Ways To Sustainable Use & Manage Water Across Society Saving and conserving water are both part of the bigger picture of sustainably managing and using fresh water i.e. making sure there are adequate available fresh water resources to meet demand now and in the future. Sustainably managing and using water can happen on a broader social level \u2013 at the national, State/province, and city/town levels. It can also happen on the individual level. Sustainably managing and using water involves managing water supply resources, but also direct and indirect water withdrawals and consumption in the three main sectors of agriculture (in particular irrigation), industry (in particular power generation) and municipal (in particular households and public service). In fact, several important water issues might only be able to effectively be addressed at the local level. We\u2019ve already put together a few guides which outline sustainable management and use of water on a broader scale: Biggest Global Fresh Water Problems, & Solutions (and the phrases used to describe related issues) How To Save Water As A Society/In The Community How To Save Water As An Individual In Everyday Life Below, we have listed some of the different individual ways that water can be sustainably used and managed: Water Efficiency Reducing Or Eliminating Water Leaks & Losses Reducing Direct Water Consumption Reducing Indirect Water Consumption Managing Water Withdrawals Reducing Water Waste Water Recycling & Re-Use Reducing Water Pollution & Contamination Treating & Purifying Inadequate Quality Water Generating Fresh Water (e.g. from water desalination ), Harvesting Fresh Water & Increasing Capacity (some argue AWG is one sustainable way to generate freshwater, whilst others disagree) Substituting Fresh Water For An Alternative There\u2019s also indirect factors to consider. Water Efficiency Getting the same production for a lesser amount of water, or getting more production for the same amount of water.\n"}

Both RO and NF benefit from pretreatment With the smallest pores of all filtration membranes, RO and NF membranes can foul quickly if larger particles aren\u2019t removed by upstream filtration technologies, such as media filtration or MF/UF. Pretreating process streams to remove these problematic particulates can also reduce the amount of energy needed to maintain adequate pressure in a RO/NF system. When process streams are sufficiently pretreated, RO/NF membranes can have a long service life and require relatively little maintenance. This is because feed water constantly flows across the surface of the filtration membrane in what is called crossflow filtration, which results in rejected substances being swept away with the waste stream, as opposed to caking onto the membrane. Both RO and NF require pressure to function While RO and NF are fairly efficient purification technologies, both demand energy to move water across their membranes. This is because their fine pores result in a high concentration of salts and other compounds on the retentate side of the membrane, and as a result, enough pressure must be applied that the water is able to overcome the osmotic pressure that causes water to resist flowing through the membrane. Both are used in place of conventional treatment technologies Conventional water treatment trains typically consist of several unit processes, including: coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, clarification, ion exchange, and filtration. While conventional treatment systems are effective in removing dissolved solids, they do so through a complex series of steps that often demand a large footprint and investment in an assortment of specialized equipment and chemical agents. As RO/NF membrane technologies have become more efficient and affordable in recent years, they are increasingly being adopted as more compact, efficient, and environmentally-friendly alternatives to conventional treatment trains.\n"}

Researchers in various international programs have studied the potential use of remotely sensed data to obtain accurate information on land surface processes and conditions. These studies have demonstrated that quantitative assessment of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer processes can lead to a better understanding of the relationships between crop growth and water management. Remote sensing and GIS was used to map the agriculture area and for detect the change. This was very useful for mapping availability and need of water resources but the problem was concentrating in data collection and analysis because this kind of information and expertise are not available in all country in the world mainly in the developing and under developed country or third world country. However, even though considerable progress has been made over the past 20 years in research applications, remotely sensed data remain underutilized by practicing water resource managers. This paper seeks to bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners first, by illustrating where research tools and techniques have practical applications and, second, by identifying real problems that remote sensing could solve. An important challenge in the field of water resources is to utilize the timely, objective and accurate information provided by remote sensing.\n"}

That is, per capita water use increases rapidly with economic development to a \u201cturning point\u201d where it begins to decline (Figure 1). Examples of industrialized countries that have experienced declining per capita water use include the United States and Japan. In the US, per capita water use peaked in 1975 and then declined nearly 30% over the next 30 years (Pacific Institute, 2009). Although most progress in the US has been attributable to improved industrial and agricultural efficiency, the use of water efficient appliances and fixtures in homes, institutions and businesses can contribute greatly to water conservation efforts. In Japan, residential per capita water use increased by about 25% in the 1980s, leveled off in the 1990s and began to decline in 2000. This progress has been attributed to the increasing use of water efficient appliances and fixtures (Nakagawa et al., 2010). Figure 1: Industrial water use vs. GDP per capita in the USA, UK, Japan and the Netherlands (source: Yang and Jia, 2005) The most common water efficient appliances include dishwashers and clothes washing machines; popular fixtures include toilets, showerheads and faucets.

This causes the diarrhea and stomach churning that those with IBS know well. In others, the brain signals are underactive, and their gut may slow down, resulting in constipation, gas, and abdominal discomfort. How stress may trigger IBS The body\u2019s goal is to maintain homeostasis, or a steady state of being. After a stress response, fluctuating hormones are meant to return to normal levels. However, when people experience chronic stress and anxiety, their bodies can\u2019t achieve homeostasis. This is often the case when a person has IBS. Stress can wreak havoc on your gut. It causes the release of many hormones, including corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). This hormone is linked to the gut\u2019s healthy bacteria, which maintains bowel function.\n"}

But studies show they can happen together. When a doctor talks to people with this digestive disorder, \"what you find is that about 60% of IBS patients will meet the criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders,\" says Edward Blanchard, PhD, professor of psychology at the State University of New York at Albany. The most common mental ailment people with IBS have is generalized anxiety disorder, Blanchard says. He thinks more than 60% of IBS patients with a psychiatric illness have that type of anxiety. Another 20% have depression, and the rest have other disorders. Regardless of whether they have irritable bowel syndrome, people with anxiety tend to worry greatly about issues such as health, money, or careers. Thos can lead to other symptoms that include upset stomach, trembling, muscle aches, insomnia, dizziness, and irritability. There are several theories about the connection between IBS, stress, and anxiety: Although psychological problems like anxiety don\u2019t cause the digestive disorder, people with IBS may be more sensitive to emotional troubles. Strong emotions like stress, anxiety, and depression trigger chemicals in the brain that turn on pain signals in your gut that may cause your colon to react.\n"}

Table of Contents[show] IBS and Stress: A History Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifunctional disorder of the gastrointestinal (GI) system that is most often associated with a wide realm of symptoms. IBS symptoms can include: Diarrhea and/or constipation Abdominal Pain Anxiety, depression, and brain symptoms Bloating Gas Visceral Hypersensitivity For a long time, physicians considered IBS to be a strictly stress-related disorder, meaning that people who experienced consistent stresses in their lives were more likely to either exacerbate or cause their GI symptoms and IBS to occur. But, just chalking the illness up solely to stress didn\u2019t make sense because practically everyone deals with stress. We now understand that stress plays a role in symptom management, but the growing research in the microbiome and the nervous system shows there\u2019s more to it. To better understand the relationship between IBS, stress, and anxiety, it is important to recognize the different types of factors that have been shown to correlate stress and IBS. For an effective natural solution to anxiety, many people are turning to CBD gummies. Measuring Stress: Frequency and/or intensity of major life changes that have occurred over the past 6-12 months Frequency and/or intensity of minor annoyances or hassles over the past month Minor stressful events or self-ratings of stress To determine whether any of the above-mentioned stress measurements and your IBS symptoms are related, it is recommended that you first rate and record your IBS symptoms, as well as any stress that you experienced on a daily or weekly basis for several weeks. Therefore, if you notice that your IBS symptoms are worse when you feel particularly stressed or anxious, then there is probably a relationship between the stress you experience and your symptoms that may be worth investigating.

For evenings or events that do not require a suit, look to a blazer jacket; if you\u2019re going to be out during the day and want something more casual, a sport jacket is always a flattering option. And enough with the nonsense that you\u2019ll be the only man wearing one \u2014 a jacket has time and time again been shown to help men look more masculine and authoritative.\n"}

Given their similarities, it has been suggested that the holiday has origins in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, held in mid-February. The festival, which celebrated the coming of spring, included fertility rites and the pairing off of women with men by lottery. At the end of the 5th century, Pope Gelasius I forbid the celebration of Lupercalia and is sometimes attributed with replacing it with St. Valentine\u2019s Day, but the true origin of the holiday is vague at best. Valentine\u2019s Day did not come to be celebrated as a day of romance until about the 14th century. Although there were several Christian martyrs named Valentine, the day may have taken its name from a priest who was martyred about 270 ce by the emperor Claudius II Gothicus. According to legend, the priest signed a letter \u201cfrom your Valentine\u201d to his jailer\u2019s daughter, whom he had befriended and, by some accounts, healed from blindness. Other accounts hold that it was St. Valentine of Terni, a bishop, for whom the holiday was named, though it is possible the two saints were actually one person. Another common legend states that St. Valentine defied the emperor\u2019s orders and secretly married couples to spare the husbands from war. It is for this reason that his feast day is associated with love.\n"}

St Valentine is recognised in the Christian world as the patron saint of epilepsy. What happened to St Valentine? On February 14, around the year 270 A.D., Valentine, a holy priest in Rome in the days of Emperor Claudius II, was executed.

Get the facts about this enigmatic character. Elizabeth Hanes Updated: Feb 8, 2022 Original: Feb 14, 2013 1. The St. Valentine who inspired the holiday may have been two different men. Officially recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, St. Valentine is known to be a real person who died around A.D. 270. However, his true identity was questioned as early as A.D. 496 by Pope Gelasius I, who referred to the martyr and his acts as \u201cbeing known only to God.\u201d One account from the 1400s describes Valentine as a temple priest who was beheaded near Rome by the emperor Claudius II for helping Christian couples wed. A different account claims Valentine was the Bishop of Terni, also martyred by Claudius II on the outskirts of Rome. Because of the similarities of these accounts, it\u2019s thought they may refer to the same person. Enough confusion surrounds the true identity of St. Valentine that the Catholic Church discontinued liturgical veneration of him in 1969, though his name remains on its list of officially recognized saints.\n"}

Register your event management company\u2019s business and apply for permits or licenses While you do not need an official certification or license to become an event planner, you may want to register your event management company and business\u2019s name. Then, be sure to open separate accounting for your business, and track all your expenses and income for tax purposes. Not sure where to start with your expenses? Check out this budget template. The details of registration will depend on where you live and the size of your business, so make sure to do your research beforehand. In addition, make sure you apply for the correct licenses and permits so that you don\u2019t get into any legal trouble while building your brand.

Crowdfunding The advent of crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter has made testing the appetite for new events so much easier, allowing organisers to try out ideas before risking cash. You simply provide details about your great, new event, set a fundraising target and ask wannabe attendees to pledge to buy a ticket if the event takes place. If there is not sufficient interest and you don\u2019t meet your target then the pledged money is released. Therefore, it is a risk free \u2018investment\u2019 for the attendees and also for the organiser, who does not need to stake their own funds. However, although the process is simple, attracting ticket purchasers is not necessarily as easy. You will need to hit up everyone you know to spread the word about your campaign, launch an assault on social media and dedicate much time and resources to marketing. 2 . Angel Investor Angel investors are wealthy individuals or groups of people looking for investment opportunities.

Other routes to finding an investor would be approaching existing contacts who know and trust you, or highly targeted individual investors or specialist investment groups. For example, if you want to launch a conference about innovations in cleantech, approach an investor with a track record in energy, not someone who usually places their money in real estate, for example. 3.

Look at your own resources to see how much cash you personally or your company can put into the budget. Exposing yourself to some level of risk can demonstrate your commitment and help encourage other investors, sponsors and partners get on board. 4. Bank loan Banks don\u2019t hand out loans as easily as they once did, and they are unlikely to lend against an event itself, but if you have a company with a proven track record, a business loan may be an option. Alternatively you can borrow against an existing asset, such as your house, but unless you are 100% certain your event will be a success you will have to give this one a lot of thought before committing.\n"}

TLDR: Key Differences Between Trello Vs. Jira Cost: Jira is free for up to 10 users, with paid plans starting at $7.50 per user. By contrast, the basic version of Trello is free forever with unlimited users, and its paid plans start a little cheaper, at $5 per user. Complexity: Jira is designed especially for agile project management and is much more complex than Trello, requiring a steep learning curve for new users. Its main features are Kanban boards, Sprints, access controls and reports. Meanwhile, Trello is much more simple to use and is adaptable to different use cases. The Kanban-style software can be customized to your needs using Power-Ups which offer similar functionalities to Jira. For example, Blue Cat Reports on Trello will allow you to create beautiful, informative reports to help you understand and improve your workflow. Target users: Jira is mainly used by software developers, engineers, and product managers in mid-market and enterprise organisations, and its pricing reflects this.\n"}

Whether you're new to market research, this guide will provide you with a blueprint for conducting a thorough study of your market, target audience, competition, and more. What is Market Research? Primary vs. Secondary Research Types of Market Research How To Do Market Research Market Research Report Template Market Research Examples What is market research? Market research is the process of gathering information about your target market and customers to verify the success of a new product, help your team iterate on an existing product, or understand brand perception to ensure your team is effectively communicating your company's value effectively. Market research can answer various questions about the state of an industry, but it's hardly a crystal ball that marketers can rely on for insights on their customers. Market researchers investigate several areas of the market, and it can take weeks or even months to paint an accurate picture of the business landscape. However, researching just one of those areas can make you more intuitive to who your buyers are and how to deliver value that no other business is offering them right now. Certainly you can make sound judgment calls based on your experience in the industry and your existing customers. However, keep in mind that market research offers benefits beyond those strategies.\n"}

However, it\u2019s important to remember that your company\u2019s licensing needs will vary wildly based upon the type of business you\u2019re running and what types of activities you plan to carry out. Licences to play music (including background music): If your business intends to play recorded music, stage live music events in public, play live music in a theatre or used sound recordings for a theatrical production, you must apply to the PPL PRS for what is called \u2018TheMusicLicence\u2019. The cost of this licence normally varies based on the type of venue where you\u2019re playing music and how that music is used, but the rules apply to all shops, offices, salons, cinemas, restaurants, cafes, pubs, churches and more. Public space surveillance (CCTV) licence: This type of licence is required if you want to protect your company premises using CCTV equipment. Before you\u2019re allowed to start using CCTV, you will need to get a licence from the Security Industry Authority (SIA) if you plan to record the activities of members of the public in a public or private place. There are two types of SIA licences. The first is a front line licence for operatives who are carrying out surveillance. The second is a non-front line licence for company managers, supervisors and other staff who don\u2019t regularly monitor CCTV activities. To obtain a licence, you must be at least 18 years old, pass an identity check and pass a criminal record check.\n"}
