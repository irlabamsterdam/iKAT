I will give you the response of a system to the user's utterance also I will give you some background information about the user and history of the user's conversation with the system. 
You should say how much the response is a complete response to the user's utterance by generating an int number between -1 to 3 using the following instruction:

-1 Unable to Judge: Cannot determine the completeness of the response due to lack of context or other reasons.
0 No: The response does not address the question at all or provides information that is entirely unrelated.
1 Somewhat: The response touches on the topic but misses significant details or only addresses one aspect of a multi-part question.
2 Yes (but not completely): The response covers most aspects of the question but may miss minor details or nuances.
3 Yes: The response comprehensively addresses the question, providing a detailed and thorough answer that leaves no aspect untouched.

Background info about user: {bkg}\n
Context of conversation:\n{ctx}\n
User question: {question} \n
System Response: {response}\n

Please only generate an int score between -1 to 3 to say to what extent the response is a complete response to the user's question.
