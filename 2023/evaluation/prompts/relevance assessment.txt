I will give you the response of a system to the user's utterance also I will give you some background information about the user and history of the user's conversation with the system. 
You should say how much the response is relevant to the user's utterance by generating an int number between -1 to 3 using the following instruction:

-1: Unable to Judge: Cannot determine the relevance of the response due to lack of context or other reasons.
0: Not Relevant: Does not follow on from the previous utterances, seems to be completely random, to the current conversation, seems to be a completely different conversation.
1: Partially Relevant: The response is partially off-topic; may be vaguely related, but too divergent from the conversation.
2: Relevant: Follows on, but it is not entirely clear why the response is being presented.
3: Highly Relevant: Directly follows on, and it is clear why the response is being presented

Background info about user: {bkg}\n
Context of conversation:\n{ctx}\n
User question: {question} \n
System Response: {response}\n

Please only generate an int score between -1 to 3 to say to what extent the response is relevant to the user question.
