        "\n",
        "The fourth year of CAsT aimed to add more conversational elements to the interaction streams, by introducing mixed initiatives (clarifications, and suggestions) to create multi-path, multi-turn conversations for each topic. TREC iKAT evolves CAsT into a new track to signal this new trajectory. iKAT aims to focus on supporting multi-path, multi-turn, multi-perspective conversations, i.e., for a given topic, the direction and the conversation that evolves depends not only on the prior responses but also on the user (and their background/perspective/context/etc). As different personas undertake various topics, systems need to build and develop a picture of who the user is, in order to best address their information needs. Put another way, iKAT focuses on system understanding of user knowledge and information needs in accordance to the available context.\n"

            "Turn Context: Hey, Assistant! I am wondering what to cook for dinner tonight for my family.|||Hey there! There are many healthy and delicious recipes you could try! For example, a stir-fry with lean proteins like chicken or tofu and a variety of colorful vegetables is always a good option. Or you could try making a Mediterranean quinoa salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese, and a light lemon vinaigrette. Baked salmon with a side of roasted vegetables is also a great choice.|||Nah, we had salmon just two days ago. But the Mediterranean dish that you mentioned sounds interesting, could you provide the recipe for that?|||Ah, I see. Of course! Here's a simple recipe for Mediterranean Quinoa Salad. The ingredients you need are 1 cup quinoa, 2 cups water, 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, 2 limes, juiced, 2 teaspoons ground cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional), 1 1/2 cups halved cherry tomatoes, 1 cucumber, diced, 1/2 cup chopped fresh mint, 1/2 cup feta cheese. Instructions: Bring quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 10 to 15 minutes. Set aside to cool. In a large bowl, whisk olive oil, lime juice, cumin, salt, and red pepper flakes together to create the dressing. In the bowl with the dressing, mix in quinoa, tomatoes, cucumber, and mint. Stir until well mixed. Top with feta cheese before serving. Enjoy!|||That's great, thanks! But I'm thinking of reducing the amount of oil in the dressing. Any suggestions?|||Certainly! You can reduce the amount of oil by using more lime juice or adding some water. Alternatively, you could substitute some of the oil with a different kind of liquid like vinegar. This should maintain a good balance between tartness and the need for oil as an emulsifier. Which of these do you think works the best for you?|||Thanks! My children don't like vinegar, so I would probably go with lime juice. Can I also use butter instead?|||Butter can be substituted for vegetable oil in some dishes, but not always. Butter is a solid fat, while vegetable oil is liquid, so they have different effects on the consistency and texture of the food. Butter is also higher in calories and lower in trans fats than vegetable oil. If you want to use butter instead of vegetable oil, you may need to adjust the quantity, melt it down, and let it cool a bit. For example, 1 cup of butter equals 7/8 cup of vegetable oil.|||I see, thanks! What are some cheese substitutes?|||I can suggest some alternatives for feta cheese. One option is to use a lower fat cheese like mozzarella. Another is to use a plant-based cheese substitute, if you're open to vegan options. You could also try adding a bit of nutritional yeast for a cheese-like flavor with less fat and more protein.|||Can you compare the first two?\n"
