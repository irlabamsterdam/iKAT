This zip contains queries extracted from the train and test topics in `queries_train.txt` and `queries_test.txt`.

The top-1000 results for each query are listed in the text files in `query_results_train` and `query_results_test`. The query-to-result-file mapping is done using line numbers, counting from 0. So e.g. `query_results_train/query_results_000.txt` contains the results for the query on line 1 of `queries_train.txt`. 

Each line of each result file has the format `ClueWeb22-ID,URL`.
