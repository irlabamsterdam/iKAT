<h1>TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT)<h1>

The iKAT builds on the experience of four successful years of the TREC Conversational Assistance Track (CAsT), 
where the key focus of iKAT is on researching and developing collaborative information seeking conversational agents 
which can tailor and personalize their response based on what they learn about and from the user.

The fourth year of CAsT aimed to add more conversational elements to the interaction streams, by introducing mixed initiatives 
(clarifications, and suggestions) to create multi-path, multi-turn conversations for each topic. 
TREC iKAT evolves CAsT into a new track to signal this new trajectory. 
The iKAT aims to focus on supporting multi-path, multi-turn, multi-perspective conversations, i.e., for a given topic, 
the direction and the conversation that evolves depends not only on the prior responses but also on the user
(and their background/perspective/context/etc). 
As different personas undertake various topics, systems need to build and develop a picture of who the user is, 
in order to best address their information needs. 
Put another way, iKAT focuses on a system understanding of user knowledge and information needs in accordance with the available context.
